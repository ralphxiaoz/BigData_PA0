review/summary: Three-year-old loves it
review/text: My nephew (3) loves this book and asks to have it read to him over and over. The down side is that it seems a little longer than most children's books so if you start reading it and have to read it more than once, it can be quite time consuming. The pictures might look pretty unimpressive to an adult, but he surprisingly picks up a fair amount of detail and ask questions about the animals that he sees, whether it's nighttime, where the train is going, etc. Great book to keep a 3-year-old boy entertained.

review/summary: First 'real' book our Very Active 2 year old will sit through in entirety!
review/text: My 3rd son loves trains much more than my 1st who loved them a lot, but...although he doesn't have a ton of words yet and is only starting to put 3 or more words together can tell you the entire plot of this story...fills in the word missing if you stop for a second...points out people in the book as his cat, his grandma, etc...it has everything a train loving kid could ask for including another favorite with sounds and farm animals! Great classic...hope they come out with a board book for those nights when you really need to get them to bed!!! or to take in the car!!!

review/summary: Cassette is useless, but the story is delightful
review/text: Choo Choo the runaway engine is a delightful story that mesmerizes three to four year old boys who like trains. Our son asks for this volume each night.As with all of Virginia Lee Burton's books, the illustrations are delightful, here all rendered in charcoal, which is strangely appropriate for the "shiny black engine" at the center of the story.The story is simple and easily understood by little readers, and they can pick out some words and map them to the illustrations. There is nothing objectionable in the tale, involving an engine who wants to break free of her responsibilities and run away to be the center of attention. Her engineer, conductor, and coal-man all work hard to chase her and bring her back, and she learns the lesson that running away from those who care for you typically ends in disaster.We bought our edition in London, without the cassette, which strikes me as a bit datted in this CDROM and DVD era.Highly recommended.

He confirms that the "coal car fell off the bridge onto the barge and now the train derrick picks it up." all the sketches are black and white and quite unique. i recommend this book for all ages, boy or girl.

When you have to put the book down, you find yourself reliving what you've just read over and over.I've found that now I have been educated and enlightened from reading about Toby's quest. It's sure got me thinking and wondering how this could possibly be fiction.I am looking forward to reading more stories written by JW Coffey and would love to see this book one day as a movie.

review/summary: A Unique Experience
review/text: The Savior by J. W. Coffey is not just a book to read. It is truly a book to be &quot;experienced&quot;.I was then and am now, completely and totally intrigued by this book. And that is rather an understatement! As I read, I would find myself having to close the book and sit back while I pondered what I had just experienced......and it WAS an experience. The further I delved into the intricately woven plots, the more I had to sit back and contemplate, not because it was confusing but because it offered so many avenues I had never really explored.The Savior is a remarkable book filled with endless possibilities from the present to the ancient past and beyond. It is so well written it is difficult to believe it is a work of fiction. I know that I will read this book again and again, and everytime I will find another new road to travel.J. W. Coffey is an amazing author with a unique gift that is rare today. I am so looking forward to &quot;experiencing&quot; more of her works.

review/text: This is an engaging book about the ultimate 'what if'. I was completely caught up in the story of Toby, and his fantastic journey through time, back to the youth of the carpenter. Historical persons are rendered with balance and imagination, yet are completely plausible in this completely different perspective of life in 20A.D. I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Entertainment without being preachy!!!
review/text: I have to say, I was a bit unsure about this book by the title. I thought it would be one of those books that preaches about something. It wasn't. The story is intense, and the plot is believable. The characters were real to me, and there are several places where the heart strings get plucked. Toby is an "everyman" and I know guys just like him. To be able to go back in time and meet someone like Jesus (Yeshua) and walk with him must have been incredible. And get to learn of other cultures in fiction. This is a must read and I had to. Took me two days of steady reading, but I could not put it down. Well done, J. W., and here's to more in the future. Keep writing those books.

review/text: If the title of this book is keeping you away you are missing out on what could easily be the best book I've ever read. This book took my mind, my heart and my soul to places that they enjoyed immensely. My husband is reading it now and I felt honored to give a copy to my sister for Christmas after she spotted me reading it at Thanksgiving and expressed interest in it. Read it and spread the word!! This author deserves major attention. She has a new book out, called &quot;The Brothers Campbell&quot; that is so much fun! In fact, I dare you to put either one of these books down without regret!!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: While the quality of the product is great, like so many wash pants today, there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight, and while it can be taken in with difficulty, there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size, and unless you can do it yourself, be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course, if you don't mind bunching at the waist, you'll be OK.

review/summary: Don't Trust the Images
review/text: Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. "Cafe," for example, should be "Coffee." Despite the fact that the image for "Cafe" shows a stone or very light gray color, "Cafe" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.

review/text: To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers, but not here. These are real Dockers slacks with real quality. These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price. I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section. Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well, and these are true Dockers.CA Luster

review/text: I absolutely love these (white) Dockers pants! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton. For summer wear, you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen, DKNY, Pierre Cardin, Geoffrey Beene, Stafford or other such brand. The "individual-fit" waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort.

review/summary: Individualism ready-made
review/text: I hate shopping anywhere but online. Pant sizes, however, tend to be so irregular that I've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl's (or Walmart, if it's closer). Finally, a solution: Dockers "Individual Fit." Somehow, Levi has designed a "forgiving" waistband that adjusts to the wearer, allowing the consumer to be off by an inch if not more in his measurements. Moreover, it's not a Sansabelt or half-elastic waistband that's sure to be a badge of geriatric distinction. You won't need AARP membership to feel comfortable about purchasing or wearing these.Add to the above exclusive feature the durabiity of the fabric and the consistency among styles (pleated or straight), and it's not hard to justify spending an extra ten bucks on the brand.

review/summary: So disappointed
review/text: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are "deals" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.

I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband, the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine, They fit well, and are in every other respect exactly what I expected.

review/summary: Best Dockers for the Money
review/text: The Dockers "individual fit" system works well, in that one can get by without "odd" waist sizes like 33, 35, etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. These pants are very durable, and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. An ironing every so often would probably be useful for "business casual". A good value.

review/text: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.

review/text: Vendor shipped quickly. The quality of Dockers products is getting worse with their outsourcing to different countries. I have 5 pair of these pants and they are all manufactured in different countries and the length varies plus or minus 1.5" for the same listed inseam. Plan a few dollars for inseam adjustment if you do not sew.

Even though the stores sell pleated pants doesn't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor.

review/summary: Not your typical Garnier album but great for chilling!
review/text: This is a good album. It is electronica (despite what the previous reviewer said). It's just not the usual fast thumping techno beats we have come to expect from Laurent Garnier. It's more jazzy/blues. Call it chill out sounds - perfect for relaxing after a night out clubbing. My personal favourite tracks are 9.01 - 9:06, Barbiturik Blues, Huis Clos. All beautiful, mournful sounds. The pace quickens a bit (but not much) with the tracks Control the House and Waiting for my plane. To sum up - if it's techno your after do not buy this album (try Bible of Dreams by Juno Reactor - 5 stars). If you're looking for something different albeit experimental then I highly recommend this album. Great for late night listening.

review/text: I can understand how someone looking for a banging techno record could be dissapointed, but this doesn't even look like a banging techno record. Also anyone who is a LG fan will know that he is much deeper than your run of the mill EDM artist. This album is a masterpiece, my favorit part of some of the tracks is that they bring in 1 drum, like the begining of a build and then pull back completely. Plastikman fans, IDM fans, Jazz fans and people who enjoy really interesting use of sounds will LOVE this album. (I say this because the previous descrition describes me). Bottom line, not a DANCE record not even a CHILL record, this is beatnick breaks, IDM and spoken word nu jazz (fusion, not lounge) at its absolute FINEST

review/summary: Laurent Garnier - The Cloud Making Machine
review/text: Laurent Garnier continues to make impressive strides in techno, even if his albums don't garner the attention they once did. _The Cloud Making Machine_, certainly, is quieter than his more banging productions, but the tracks still display a good deal of thought and attention. The deep modulation in "9.01-9.05" fits perfectly with the moody chords overhead. The solitary drift of "Huis Clos" sounds like a lonely, midnight stroll along the Seine. And true to the nature of clouds, sometimes the clouds lose their way: "First Reaction" doesn't have a real direction and the meandering lyrics don't help. And if you thought that "Controlling the House" would signal a switch into a 4/4 kick drum, you'd be right. It's nice to hear Garnier in his forte, even if this particular track feels slightly bland. Luckily, the rock of "(I Wanna Be) Waiting For My Plane" is anything but bland, even if it does come out of nowhere. So while _The Cloud Making Machine_ isn't Garnier's best work, it still shows he's still relevant after all these years.

review/summary: fireplace-warmth on a cool night-out
review/text: Apart from being overly electronic and techno, the french 80s' aficionado DJ remains WITHIN traditional rock esthetics. Imaginative, tentative and Pink-Floy-ish (reference: "Careful with That Axe Eugene") - warm as opposite to acid, cool or dissonant, that is. Sparce too, probably. The idiom about "finger in the pie" or something rolls on the tip of my tongue (you know what I mean) in this regard. This feel is so rare, alien to the genre of "serious" electronic stuff that no further argument is needed to let the disk enrich any rock-biased collection... and to procure that 40 Hz vibe you long despaired of with your hi-fi. Check out track 7 please.

review/summary: A documentary that really stands out
review/text: What some of the angry reviewers of this film don't seem to understand is that although there are quite a few clips of stand up bits, this is a documentary ABOUT stand up, not a collection of acts. And it's a brilliantly made documentary as well. When I started watching, I didn't know that it was going to be so specifically about the Boston stand up scene. I didn't even know that so many great comedians came out of Boston.What this documentary is really about is a brief period in the late 70s - early 80s when stand up was suddenly all the rage in Boston. Suddenly comedy clubs were popping up all over town, and stand up was something that you could really make a good living at. It was fresh, original, and every act was different. Old clips from inside the clubs really showcase some funny stuff here too.What makes this documentary so enjoyable is the obvious respect and affection that filmmaker (and Boston comedian) Fran Solomita has for every artist he interviews. He still doesn't allow his film to turn into a love fest of idolizing Boston comedians. All aspects of the movement are documented here. The initial rise, Steven Wright's first appearance on the Late Show that really set Boston ablaze, and then the downfall that occurred because of the surplus of comedians and tv channels displaying comedians... and the drugs. Can't forget the drugs.When Stand Up Stood Out is just a really well made film about a very specific group of people in a specific area, but it alludes to the fact that stand up was exploding everywhere at this time, Boston was just the heart of it.There are great interviews and clips from comedians you may have never heard of and many that you have. All have their own insights into the process and the business and it's all interesting. This film is definitely never boring.The DVD contains tons of extras. There's an interview with Dane Cook talking about how he was affected by all the great Boston comedians before him. There's a good deal of clips from Bobcat Goldthwaite, Larry Clarke, and some "man on the street" clips from Kevin Meaney. There's also a making of featurette that really offers a lot of behind the scene information. Overall, this is a great DVD and worth every cent.

review/text: This was a good documentary on the history of two local comedy clubs in Boston. Since I am not from Boston, never been to Boston, and never will ever go to Boston, it was good for a one time viewing only.I agree with others that the cover of the DVD is misleading. I think that they purposely designed it to look like these people are actually performing routines, as an attempt to sell more copies, nationwide. Most people are pretty self centered and could care less about local comedy in an area other than their own.I give it two and a half stars. I thought that it would actually have some funny scenes in it and was disappointed when there was not any.

review/summary: Live Through This
review/text: I read about this DVD in The Boston Phoenix and bought it immediately about five months ago. I didn't even play it for a long while after I received it from Amazon. I finally watched it this past weekend. I have to admit, in the interest of full disclosure, I once worked for WBCN-FM in Boston as a non paid producer for the Mark Parenteau afternoon drive show back when radio at least resembled the radio we grew up with. One of the jobs I did to make money doing was editing the swear words out of the stand up routine these comics did at Stitches Comedy Club, which at one time existed in the same building at The Paradise Rock Club many years ago, for Mark's daily comedy portion of his show. I also was a 1982 graduate of Emerson College and having witnessed Lauren Dombrowski, Eddie Brill, Mario Cantone, and Denis Leary and several other folks up close and personal at the Emerson Comedy Workshop my review is probably a little skewered. Particularly because I was directly involved in the scene I have to say I really enjoyed this. I met nearly every one of these comics as they came to the studio to do live comedy over the years. Most of them were very nice people. Lenny Clarke was a tremendous personality and I never stopped laughing while he was around. I didn't even really get into comedy clubs outside of Emerson until 1981 or so. Cambridge, home to The Ding Ho, seemed like another country for a college student in a major metropolitan city with no car and a $45 a week work study job so I never even set foot in the place. That was the most interesting part of the DVD for me. I didn't know Barry Crimmins found the place by blind luck and the like. I didn't know about the house with the high hang factor where everybody seem to crash. I ended up leaving the radio station in 1986 and really always wondered why a number of the comedy clubs closed. They really don't finish the story that way, but I guess it really doesn't matter. I think I was at a couple of the shows while they were taping during though I've heard some of those jokes so many times I'd be hard pressed to prove it. The only reason I don't give this five stars is huge though. You come away from this DVD wondering if Fran Solomita and Steve Sweeney, a Boston comic legend, have a running grudge or something. There was only one scene where Steve Sweeney even got a cameo! Kevin Meaney, a great comic no doubt, was nowhere near the comic icon that Steve Sweeney was in this town at that time, got plenty of face time with the camera. The fact that he was not featured prominently in this DVD is a flat out crime. Everyone mentioned deserved their place in the film, but the Sweeney omission is glaring. Also, it would have been a lot cooler if they had shown clips of the other major national acts such as Jerry Seinfeld (though I'm sure that icon's image would have blown the budget of the film if he were to be a jerk about it) interacting with the local talent. I'm sure Drew Carey and several others played the same clubs on the same night as well and that would have made for great background concerning how big this scene really was. The Steven Wright and Bob Goldthwait stories were also very interesting. I thought guys like DJ Hazard, Chance Langton, Mike Donovan, Mike McDonald, and George McDonald sort of got short shrift as the rank and file underpinning comics that kept the big boys front and center and filled the bill night after night, but overall I like the format and the content. Another monster talent in Anthony Clarke might have been from a slightly different comic generation, but he should have gotten some kudos too I thought. I can see, however, that folks not from Boston would not enjoy this DVD half as much as those of us who lived through it, but this is a must own for that crowd. I enjoyed the heck of it despite the odd absence of Steve Sweeney. I'm glad somebody documented it because it was insane and the money was really flowing. I saw Craig Ferguson a couple of weeks ago at the New Comedy Connection in Faneuil Hall and loved it. You still can't beat a good comedy show.

review/summary: Born near Boston? Gotta love comedy!!!
review/text: I was born and raised just outside of Boston, where I lived for the first 20 years of my life. When I moved to Florida, I realized that the rest of the world was not at all like 'we' were!! The sarcasm and wit inherent to New Englanders, and Bostonians in particular, is something to behold!!The first time I saw "When Stand Up Stood Out", I was almost on the floor laughing so hard at times!! It is so honest, so true to form, and so rich with the texture of Boston as it really was.... I have watched it many times since, and every time, I enjoy it just as much!!I definately recommend this, especially to fellow Yankees (not NY) ha, ha!! It's a great and interesting documentary on some very funny history!!

review/summary: Although it is documentary....not a comedy stand up, it's informative, insightful.
review/text: For those specifically interested in the birth of comedy clubs throughout the Boston area, this will be of interest. And, for those who wish to learn the nuts and bolts & nitty gritty of that area where standup clubs dominated, this, too, will be of interest.The premise of the DVD is the rise of young comedians primarily of the Boston area during the late 70's early 80's. They have stories to tell, the big breaks, stardom, influx of comedians claiming to be from Boston, the many clubs, intense competition, etc., etc.,Some names you will recognize, Denis Leary, Colin Quinn, Lenny Clark, Kevin Meany...but others you won't. There are clips of the acts, but nothing riotious as the box cover claims.So don't expect a standup comedy act of the comedians, as this is documentary, and it is informative at that. If you do see bits, the work is average. ...Rizzo

review/summary: Comedy Scene, and Not Heard
review/text: This DVD will be a disappointment if you get it hoping to see some substantial portion of the acts of the various comics listed on the cover. All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out together and getting their start.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Summertime
review/text: I saw Ocracoke Island's Katy Mitchell @ the Turnage Theatre in Washington, North Carolina last night & picked up this CD. Her current show billed as "The Katy Mitchell Band" was unusual with Katy seemingly happy to be relegated to backup singer for most of the night. I thought it should be retitled "The Guy In Blue Shorts Band." Katy kept pulling at the bodice of her bright yellow sun dress. While the lead singer's voice broke on "All I Do Is Dream," they did some nice numbers like "Shampoo," "Fever" and "Summertime," which is on this CD."Baby It's You" has more of a rock feel than the folk roots set. Mitchell is a strong vocalist with this set being mostly recognizable cover tunes. The Box Topps' "The Letter" opens the set with a strong reading. "Here Comes the Night" and "Leave Me Alone" are tracks composed by her father Gary who is with the band Molasses Creek. She has a good feel for her father's music. Katy snakes her way through the Bobbie Gentry classic "Ode to Billy Joe," milking the nuances from the lyric. The title track is the Burt Bacharach song that was recorded by the Beatles, the Shirelles and a top 10 version by a band called Smith. Katy's version has a Jimmy Buffet relaxed feel to it. On Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'," Katy focuses on the lovely melody, exchanging Dylan's emotional urgency for what seems like an acceptance of change. Joni Mitchell's classic "Big Yellow Taxi" concludes the set which doesn't stray too much from the original. "Baby Its You" shows potential. Enjoy!

review/summary: Star Trek: Nemesis
review/text: Star Trek: Nemesis novelization by J.M. Dillard and the story written by John Logan, Rick Berman, and Brent Spiner is an action-adventure book steeped in Romulan intrigue. This is a Jean-Luc Picard and Data book with an advisary that is very personal to Captain Picard.We've been reading a lot in the Trek genre about the Romulans, but what about their sister planet Remus? This is the binary twin of Romulus, but with a very different and mysterious inhabitants. Remus is like our moon as it does NOT rotate and life only exists on the border of light and dark, but for generations Remus was nothing but a mining colony for dilithium crystals. Remus as a planet with a voice in the Romulan politics was never considered, but that is about to change.The book opens with the Senate chamber on Romulus as it is taken over by the arch villian through proxy. Back on Earth under the pure blue skies of the Alaskan day Will Riker and Deanna Troi are about to tie the knot in a wedding ceremony. In attendance are all the major characters in the Next Generation Crew. Will Riker is soon to be Captain Will Riker and his wife ships Counselor,Deanna Troi, will be on a ship of their own, while Captain Picard will carry-on with Data as Number One. So, this is the last time that all of these principles will be together for a long time.Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-E are abruptly diverted for a rather unexpected diplomatic mission, to none other than Romulus. The Romulan Star Empire is the last major power in the Alpha Quadrant... a longtime sworen enemy of the Federation has now expressed their desire to initiate negotiations for unity in the Alpha Quaddrant.As Captain Jean-Luc Picard enters in negotiations, the Enterprise and her crew are faced with a threat that could jeopardise everything... even the destruction of Earth itself.If you saw the movie, you must read the book as it fills in a lot of the gaps and leaps in logic that they left on the cutting room floor. There is action, intrigue, mystery and adventure that is non-stop as the book gives you emotions as the characters play out the story. I must say the movie does dojustice to the novel and the movie is true to the book.There is a section within the pages of the book that has pictures from the movie and a section that is called "A First Look" that has stills from the making of the movie. This is one of the better TREK books with a believeable storyline.

review/summary: Star Trek At It's Finest!
review/text: In this story the Enterprise finds a prototype of the android Data near the Romulan neutral zone, and soon after the Enterprise is called upon to visit the planet Romulus at the request of Shinzon, the new Praeter of the Romulan Empire. Shinzon has a mysterious origin, soon to be revealed, and he professes peace between Romulus and the Federation, but can he be trusted? This novel is full of intrigue and action, and becomes philosophical at times, in a well concieved plot, with good character development, a joy to read even after first seeing the movie. Much of this novel centers around Data and what it means to be human, including friendships perhaps worth dying for, very well executed.I have seen the movie also, I consider it to be one of the two top films for 2002, no exceptions, and about as good as THE WRATH OF KHAN. The screenplay was written by John Logan, Rick Berman, and Brent Spiner, with the novelization by J.M. Dillard, all Star Trek fans in their own right and also great talent. John Logan gives a moving introduction here in this book. This is great page-turning science fiction.

review/text: After having read the book and have seen the movie, I must say that the book is deffinately worth reading. I also thought that the plot of the book was a combination of Star Trek 2 and Star Trek 6. Questionable as to whether this is the true end for this crew or not. The story is left so open for another, but that is also to be expected. I liked the end scenes in the book better than in the movie. All in all I would highly recomend this book.

review/summary: Holds interest even if you remember the film in detail
review/text: There was never a happier time for the officers of Jean-Luc Picard's Enterprise, as Will Riker and Deanna Troi marry with their friends and colleagues surrounding them. Meanwhile, on far-off Romulus, the senate chamber lights with death planted by a saboteur - death that clears the way for a Human reared on Remus to take power there. Shinzon, the "Reman but not Reman" whom the long-enslaved inhabitants of that world claim as their prophesied savior, need Jean-Luc Picard in order to survive. Even though Picard, toasting Riker and Troi at their Alaskan wedding reception, doesn't yet know the much younger man exists.J.M. Dillard's novelizations of the Star Trek films are always well done, and this book is no exception. It fills in much that the movie skimmed or skipped over entirely, and by so doing holds the reader's interest even if that reader recalls the film in detail. I enjoyed it thoroughly.

review/summary: WONDERFUL
review/text: Oh, I really enjoyed reading this book. I went to see the movie and was so caught up in the story that I ordered the book ... right away.First of all, the book is true to the screenplay, down to dialogue, although there were some additions and adjustments in the novelization. It was also a plus to have the introduction and commentary on the making of the movie at the end.I find it hard to accept that this might really be the end of "The Next Generation," and yet I don't see how they could come together again after this movie. I mean, you could bring all the actors together and have a good script, but as a fan, having now watched these characters evolve, and move on, it would be like watching your kids move back home.The novel did fill in some spots I felt a bit confused about, explaining certain bits of dialogue, especially lines by Worf.I felt the book was very well written. Congratulations.

review/text: I ordered these slacks specifically because the description said they had a comfort-fit waistband. I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband, the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine, They fit well, and are in every other respect exactly what I expected. However, the fact is that they are still not what I ordered and are not as described.

review/summary: Best Dockers for the Money
review/text: The Dockers "individual fit" system works well, in that one can get by without "odd" waist sizes like 33, 35, etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. These pants are very durable, and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. An ironing every so often would probably be useful for "business casual". A good value.

Although there was a tag on the pants that said they were individual fit, thy lacked the inside label I am used to seeing stating they were individual fit.

review/summary: So disappointed
review/text: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are "deals" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.

review/text: While the quality of the product is great, like so many wash pants today, there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight, and while it can be taken in with difficulty, there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size, and unless you can do it yourself, be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course, if you don't mind bunching at the waist, you'll be OK.

Despite the fact that the image for "Cafe" shows a stone or very light gray color, "Cafe" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.

Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well, and these are true Dockers.CA Luster

For summer wear, you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen, DKNY, Pierre Cardin, Geoffrey Beene, Stafford or other such brand. The "individual-fit" waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort.

review/summary: Individualism ready-made
review/text: I hate shopping anywhere but online. Pant sizes, however, tend to be so irregular that I've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl's (or Walmart, if it's closer). Finally, a solution: Dockers "Individual Fit." Somehow, Levi has designed a "forgiving" waistband that adjusts to the wearer, allowing the consumer to be off by an inch if not more in his measurements. Moreover, it's not a Sansabelt or half-elastic waistband that's sure to be a badge of geriatric distinction. You won't need AARP membership to feel comfortable about purchasing or wearing these.Add to the above exclusive feature the durabiity of the fabric and the consistency among styles (pleated or straight), and it's not hard to justify spending an extra ten bucks on the brand.

review/summary: This is the new formula- NOT vintage as pictured
review/text: Received the order very quickly but what arrived and what was advertised and pictured are two different things. The Vetiver being sold here is the new 2011 formulation by Guerlain. Yet the picture shows the vintage version which looks quite different on the box & only minor differences on the bottle. The vintage formula that is so highly desired and hard to find is exactly as shown in the pic. The new 2011 formula comes in a mint green box & the bottle has a silver cap instead of the gold cap used on the vintage bottles. There is also a slight framing difference on the decal of the bottle between the versions too.Yes, I should have known better than to think that I'd get vintage Vetiver at such an amazing price & on Amazon Prime shipping too. But I trusted that what Amazon had pictured was what I would receive. I ended up keeping the 2 bottles I ordered since the price was great & I wanted to try out the new formulas to see if Guerlain finally got their act together and mimicked the classic version smell. The 2011 formula does NOT smell close to the vintage formula that is so incredible; but the 2011 formula is not bad either. Had I never had the vintage formula I would have liked this new version even better. But after the classic, vintage Vetiver hits your nose, nothing else will satisfy except the superior classic smell of the old formula which Guerlain refuses to bring back. (do a search on any search engine for Guerlain Vetiver vintage and you will be shocked at some of the blogs and articles read as far as the depth to which Guerlain has gone to disrespect and spite their consumers over the classic formula- it's very interesting & leaves the question of why a company would go through so much to keep the vintage formula off the new & used markets)The 2-star score is not against Amazon since Amazon's customer service has been 5 stars plus, every time I needed them. Amazon's customer service 2 years ago & more was beyond abysmal. Yet today Amazon's customer service is one of the best out there if there's an issue with an order. The 2-star score is due wrong product pictured & the new 2011 Vetiver formulation being poor in comparison to the classic formulation's scent. The new formula also retains it's scent very poorly; wears off quickly even when using more.Save your money & look for something better and that lasts.

review/summary: A so-so album, but not the atrocity some say
review/text: Taken on its own, I think this is a decent album with a couple excellent songs (Breathe In, for one).However, most longtime Petra fans are probably going to compare the songs on here with the original versions and decide they don't like these new takes. Oh well.The idea of this album was to re-introduce Petra classics to a generation unfamiliar with them. But lack of airplay caused that goal to fail.Petra followed this album with superior work on "Revival" (2001) and their final studio album "Jekyll & Hyde" (2003).Fans of Petra's rock songs would do well to buy J&H.; Fans of Petra's praise songs should check out Revival.Fans who are open-minded should check out "Double Take." The music is solid and surprising.

review/summary: What's everyone talking about?!! This album is great!
review/text: Like one of the other reviews I read I also thought that this was another Petra "Best Of" CD when I first saw it in the store. Having all their CDs I didn't buy it. Then I read in a magazine that it was re-recorded versions (+ 2 new ones) and immediately bought it and I've never regretted it for a second. The way that Petra re-did these songs is amazing to me. I write songs myself and I could not imagine trying to re-write one of my own with different melodies, tempo, arrangements, etc. It just shows you how talented and brilliant these guys are. "Creed" brings tears to my eyes as much as when I first heard the original version. The new vocal melodies in the chorus of "Beyond Belief" sends chills up the spine. "Dance" is fun and upbeat just like the original but again the new vocal melodies are very cool. John Schlitt has one of the best voices in rock. The two new songs, "The Longing" and "Breathe In", are very good songs but the longtime fans will get a treat when they hear these new versions of old songs. They call this an "acoustic" album which it does have acoustic guitars but there's a lot of cool strings and such too. It's not like the whole album is like Guns N Roses' "Patience". Buy this CD!!! It's simply outstanding!!!

review/text: I have to agree with Eric. This album is much over looked and the band did an awesome job of redoing some classic Petra songs. I really like this cd, eventhough it is mellow for Petra. However, this shows you how diversified this band is. This album has superb lyrics and is almost like a praise album. Personal favorite songs are, The Longing, Dance, Beyond Belief. If you are a fan of Petra and have been turned off by this album. Stick it back in your cd player and give it another chance, that it deserves.

review/summary: It's a &quot;Double Take&quot;
review/text: The first time I heard this CD, I was rather surprised. Not at all disappointed. It was as I recalled, &quot;Different&quot;. I have all the Petra Albums to date, except their Debut ablum, Petra, and Come and Join Us. Indeed this CD was quite different. I purchased my CD in December of last year. And still everytime I listen to it, it seems to grow on me each time. From the remake of Judas Kiss (although I missed Bob's solo at the start, like the original) to the Ending of Just Reach Out, I was enthralled. Petra's change in music doesn't mean that they are going from rock, in fact if you listen closely, you still hear the cool guitar sounds and the wonderful vocals of John Schlitt. The song, &quot;Creed&quot; in this album is a classic. Like the original, there is something eerie about it. &quot;The Longing&quot;, will remain one of their coolest songs, so will &quot;Breathe In&quot;. &quot;Praying Man&quot; is one rocky song, on this ablum. Petra's remake of &quot;Beat The System&quot; is awesome. Whenever, I listen to the original and listen to this mix, I think to myeslf, &quot;Which do I like more?&quot; The answer is both!! &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; and &quot;Dance&quot;, have a new and very likeable sound in this album. &quot;This Means War&quot; took a very different turn in this album. It was slower and I like it for that. Yes, the fast and hard rocking sound (also the cool drum intro in the original &quot;This Means War&quot; album) of the original song is lost. But, not all battles are fought in a hurried way. In fact slowing things down, shows strategy, and Petra has done an exceptional job on this song. And yes, not forgeting &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; and &quot;Just Reach Out&quot;, these two songs are indeed some of the best remakes. &quot;Double Take&quot; doesn't deserve a single listening before you make your discission, you need to listen to the whole album over, and over and over again, then you'll get what I mean.All in Petra really deserved to get the Grammy for this Album. So to say the least, It's a &quot;Double Take&quot;, and Petra deserves all the Kudos they can get one of their greatest albums. A great job well done PETRA!!!

review/text: While I applaud the band's efforts in reconditioning many of the older songs, I do not think this was the best way to do it. I will say that &quot;The Longing&quot; is a nice new song that sounds pretty good, but it is not the rock-n-roll we want to hear from Petra. However, if Petra is looking at stretching its creative genius, then far-be-it-for-me to impede their progress. I hope this helps them grow closer together and prepare for the next album. Just do us one favor, bring back the aggressive distorted guitars, thumping rhythm section, and soaring keyboards we grew up on over the past three decades. John Schlitt, you can still sing better than anybody else in hard rock.

But why take out a bunch of really awesome songs and try to see how far you can mutate them just for the fun of it, while destroying several good songs in the process (thank goodness I have the good versions on other albums). This album makes me wonder if the band has come to the end of their creative road and are simply fishing the bottom of the barrel to try to come up with something they can release just to get the label off their backs or to make a buck. I have loved Petra for two decades, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is not Petra.

review/summary: WHOA
review/text: When I looked in the jacket of this CD, I had to laugh. They wrote inside who originally wrote these classics. Unfortunately, these new versions barely sound anything like the originals. Concert anthems like &quot;Creed&quot;, &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, and &quot;This Means War&quot; have been cut down in this album to pathetic ballads. Never in this album did I hear a HINT of a rock guitar, but I heard plenty of strings. I recommend the following to whoever made this album: 1. Get rid of the strings. 2. Bring back the original melodies. Some songs sound like their originals, but &quot;He Came, He Saw (He Conquered)&quot;, &quot;Creed&quot;, and &quot;Praying Man&quot; (They cut out the backround vocals for Praying Man in the verses) do not sound a bit like their originals. 3. Throw in some ROCK guitars, not the basic 6-strings I heard throughout. 4. Get Bob Hartman to go to the Hard Rock Cafe, get his guitar, and play on this album. 5. Remarket the album after the above changes are made.I simply do not recommend this album. Petra is either out of gas forever or they just need some refilling. Buy PETRAFIED, BEYOND BELIEF, and ROCK BLOCK if you want Petra. Buy this album if you want this stringfilled, balladlike folly.This is an album called DOUBLE TAKE by a contemporary Christian band called Petra. It was made in 1999.I am going to go listen to ON FIRE!. It is by a heavy metal band called Petra. It was made in 1988.Wait a minute, ON FIRE! and DOUBLE TAKE couldn't possibly be by the same band!Or so I thought.Skip this disappointer.

review/summary: DOUBLE TAKE IS A BEAUTIFUL SOUND!
review/text: I have had the Double Take album for 5 months now and I still listen to the album every day, sometimes all day. Double Take is a masterpiece from the Petra Ministry, the message in the music is very moving and the sound of the orchestra just reaches for your heart. Yes, it did take about 2 weeks to really get into the sound but now I consider it the best Petra album in there 28 year history. Beat The System, This Means War, Creed, and The Coloring Song have a very beautiful sound. The voice of John Schlitt with the 42 piece orchestra in the background gives it an acoustic/hard rock feel. I give this album 5 stars because of the musical content and the ministerial outreach, the album is a very good starting tool for new Christians because Double Take has a taste of everything. THANK GOD FOR PETRA!

review/summary: An HONEST review
review/text: First off, I've been a Petra fan since &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; was brand new. Second, I like all the phases of Petra, even though the revolving door personel problem needs to be addressed. After reading all 32 of the previous reviews I was shocked to see all the terrible reviews the album got, especially the reviews that personally attacked John Schlitt. This album was supposed to be different, was I the only one who understood that &quot;Double Take&quot; meant a second look? The concept of restructering classic songs in an acoustic style was different to say the least. On some songs, most notably &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; it really works. On others, &quot;He Came ...&quot; the idea doesn't work so well. I think the songs that fall short do so due to lyric structure and better songs could have been selected. If you are a true Petra fan this album will make a nice addition, if however you are a more casual fan, pick one of the &quot;Rock Block&quot; type greatest hits albums, of which there are far too many. Blame that on Star Song records and their attempt to milk their Petra catalog dry. I agree with some of the negative respondants in that the last really good album was &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;, but there have been good songs on EVERY album. I've really loved following this band for the last 18 years, I'm 29 now, and got to see them live for the FIRST, yes first time, two months ago. I wondered how I would accept Pete, Lonnie and Trent playing what I considered to be Bob, Ronnie and John Lawry songs. I was blown away by the line-ups energy, especially Pete and Lonnie. These guys are as good as ever. This concert was held at Carowind's amusement park and after Petra left the stage I went to ride some rides and literally bumped into John Schlitt while his son was riding one of the rides. I told him how much energy the band had and he said that the new studio album was going to be a &quot;rocker&quot;. Keep the faith Petra fans, the legacy begun by Bob Hartman is in good hands. One 'parting thought', to say that John Schlitt is so asinine it is hardly worth mentioning, but after meeting him in person he is one of the most honest and personable people you would ever hope to meet. And besides how many guys pushing 50 can still belt out a rocker and a ballad like this guy?

It is sad to see howdesperate Petra can get just to get on the radio: switch to pop. I personally think the change is stupid, considering that they were already very popular when they were rock music. Oh by the way: Petra means &quot;The Rock.&quot; Therefore, it is incorrect to call themselves Petra on this album. Boring string-ballads ramble through Petra classics. A previous reviewer for this album wanted to know why we wanted a greatest hits CD besides a Rework CD, like this one. Maybe because the originals were CLASSICS. This stuff is terrible.Before you claim me as an anti-Petra fan, I just want you to know I have all of their CDs, and this one is the worst. I probably am the #1 fan, or I WAS the #1 fan, until Petra Praise 2 came out.Stick to Beyond Belief, On Fire, This Means War, or the best album ever, More Power To Ya, if you want rock.Stick to Double Take if you are another one of those ( ) fans who think all of their music is great, regardless of how mellow, or downright terrible it actually is.

I would have loved it if they had a normal, not Stryperish, singer. The music itself is among the best that I have heard. I would be happier with the CD if it was only instrumental. At least it has a good Christian message. Well, the only tie-breaker that occured, for it being a three or four star, is the fact that my pastor's son is in the band. (Although he is not mentioned in the line-up. He is the new keyboardist). Well if you like Stryper and old 70's rock vocals, get this CD. But if 70's rock vocals make you sick, throw it in the trash.

review/summary: Disappointing attempt to stay current
review/text: Petra, through the 70s and 80s, were always able to stay musically current and relevant, riding the wave of that era's musical trends. They stumbled badly when the decade of the 90s rolled around. In my mind, their last classic album was Beyond Belief, and though every album since has had its high points, none has been consistently great. Now comes Double Take, an album that tries to change their big arena rock sound into an acoustic, 90's vibe. For the most part, it doesn't work, and, at times, is even painful to listen to. Unfortunately, it sounds like Petra is determined to reinvent itself for each subsequent generation. After two decades of success, their chameleon act has run out of magic.

review/summary: Potentially great but too flawed.
review/text: It's hard to believe that a band can continually adapt successfully to change, produce an album as strong as &quot;God Fixation&quot; and then seemingly spoil much of their own classic material by removing the catchy bits and immediate impact of the songs.Yet on paper this has huge potential. Songs like &quot;Just Reach Out&quot; and &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; have achieved the impossible, having retained their powerful hooks and moved on in terms of power, arrangements and &quot;atmosphere;&quot; John Schlitt CAN still compete with the best in terms of vocals!Unfortunately he can also at times spoil the album. &quot;The Coloring Song&quot; was a major radio hit first time. Second time round, it has lost its sensitivity and feel, being reduced to almost parody levels. It gets screamed out like a power ballad from &quot;This Means War,&quot; which just doesn't work with an acoustic production!Combine this with the fact that classic songs like &quot;Judas Kiss,&quot; &quot;Creed,&quot; &quot;Dance,&quot; and &quot;Beat the System&quot; have somehow left their original strong melodies behind in the production room, and the result is an album which adds up to less than the sum of its parts.Never mind - lets hope Petra can bounce back as they have done before!

review/text: I am amazed at reading the other reviews trashing this CD or Petra in general. I wonder if they forget that Petra is a _Christian Rock_ band, and wonder about their attitudes towards Petra - they're not acting very Christian in their vile reviews of this CD, but acting just like some worldly spoiled brats.That said! I enjoy this CD. My favorite track is &quot;This Means War&quot;, and I like the way things flow.I would recommend this CD to anyone.

This powerful song was not meant to be acoustic!

review/summary: Petra Remixs
review/text: This album is very good. Even though some of the remixs are a little less than what I was hoping for in this remix album the way they are done is excellent. Alot of the songs remixed are mellowed out, which more often than not gives then a much more musical sound. Praying Man is my favorite song on this album, and it rocks!! Judas Kiss, Beyond Belief, and Beat the System are really cool, toned down versions of excellent songs that sound awesome in the new mixes. This Means War is the only downside to the CD that I found. It was slowed way down, too much in my opinion, but the message is still loud and clear. Petra still rocks for the Rock.

I like the additions of some of the string sections, though.One big thing is the title. Double Take. Take a second listen to this. The CD gets better. I'm on my 4th listen now and it keeps growing on me. It is NOT traditional Petra. Very different, but VERY well done. True fans will enjoy it, but give it a few listens to.

This album is pure amazing! I love this album so much I would say it is one of my favourites of all time. I love whoever thought of the idea of redoing some of Petra's best loved songs and re inventing them acoustically! The result is a blowaway in terms of production, as the awesome wah wah guitar of Pete and the incredibly raw acoustic performance by former Whiteheart Member Brian Wooten! John and Dino are still two of the best producers around. Songs that stick out to on this album are &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;The Longing&quot; and &quot;Praying Man&quot; and the new version of &quot;Just Reach Out&quot; is a masterpiece. Pete's song &quot;Breathe In&quot; is also a masterpiece and this song high lights the talent of this young guy! John is in his full swing again on this album! His soaring vocal performances are great on every single song! Anyone who likes acoustic rock should not even consider not buying this scorcher of an album. In your face old songs that are greatly chosen! GREAT GREAT GREAT

review/text: WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE THE NEW PETRA CD IS! WITH THE EXPLOSION OF NEW ARTISTS WITHIN THE CONTEMPORY CHRISTIAN MUSIC REALM, PETRA IT SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ITS PLACE. THIS IS UNFORTUNATE, BECAUSE THEIR LAST FEW RELEASES HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY. (NO DOUBT, PETRA PRAISE 2, AND GOD FIXATION.) PETRA HAS ALWAYS MIRRORED WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE SECULAR ARENA, BUT WAS NOT QUITE THERE MUSICALLY. THE LAST FEW CDS SHOWED A BAND WHO THAT HAS NOT ONLY MATURED, BUT IMPROVED WITH AGE. THEIR CDS HAVE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO BE FORMULA IN NATURE. ANTHEMS FOR CHRISTIANS, BY CHRISTIANS. OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVE IMPROVED TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN SHARE THIS GREAT CHRISTIAN MUSIC WITH NON-CHRISTIAN FRIENDS WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT. AS THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION AS GREATLY INCREASED. THE MUSIC ITSELF HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY LESS &quot;SUGARY.&quot; THIS LEADS US TO &quot;DOUBLE TAKE.&quot; I BELIEVE IT TO BE AN EXCELLENT CROSS SECTION OF THE GREAT BODY OF WORK THAT PETRA HAS DONE OVER THE PAST 20 PLUS YEARS. WHERE MUCH OF THEIR EARLIER WORK IS A BIT DATED, THESE FRESH TAKES ON THEIR MUSIC IS A GREAT SHOT IN THE ARM. I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THIS CD WAS NOT JUST ANOTHER GREATEST HITS, OR LIVE RECORDING RELEASED FOR WHAT WOULD SEEM TO BE MONEY MAKING OR MARKETING PURPOSES. THERE APPEARS TO BE METHOD BEHIND THIS CURRENT MADNESS. METHOD OR NOT, THIS IS A GREAT STROLL DOWN MEMORY LANE FOR THE LONG TIME FAN. IT IS ALSO A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST TIME LISTENERS, WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE APPRECIATE THE POWERFUL IMPACT THESE SONGS HAD ON CHRISTIAN MUSIC. THIS CD HAD ME WONDERING...COULD A BAND LIKE THIS FIND ITS WAY INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME? BASED ON LONGEVITY, CREATIVITY AND COMMITMENT, THEY CERTAINLY SHOULD. IF AND WHEN THEY DO, YOU WILL HEAR ALOUD CHEAR COMING FROM HEAVEN, AND FROM ME!

review/summary: An HONEST review
review/text: First off, I've been a Petra fan since &quot;More Power to Ya&quot; was brand new. Second, I like all the phases of Petra, even though the revolving door personel problem needs to be addressed. After reading all 32 of the previous reviews I was shocked to see all the terrible reviews the album got, especially the reviews that personally attacked John Schlitt. This album was supposed to be different, was I the only one who understood that &quot;Double Take&quot; meant a second look? The concept of restructering classic songs in an acoustic style was different to say the least. On some songs, most notably &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; it really works. On others, &quot;He Came ...&quot; the idea doesn't work so well. I think the songs that fall short do so due to lyric structure and better songs could have been selected. If you are a true Petra fan this album will make a nice addition, if however you are a more casual fan, pick one of the &quot;Rock Block&quot; type greatest hits albums, of which there are far too many. Blame that on Star Song records and their attempt to milk their Petra catalog dry. I agree with some of the negative respondants in that the last really good album was &quot;Wake Up Call&quot;, but there have been good songs on EVERY album. I've really loved following this band for the last 18 years, I'm 29 now, and got to see them live for the FIRST, yes first time, two months ago. I wondered how I would accept Pete, Lonnie and Trent playing what I considered to be Bob, Ronnie and John Lawry songs. I was blown away by the line-ups energy, especially Pete and Lonnie. These guys are as good as ever. This concert was held at Carowind's amusement park and after Petra left the stage I went to ride some rides and literally bumped into John Schlitt while his son was riding one of the rides. I told him how much energy the band had and he said that the new studio album was going to be a &quot;rocker&quot;. Keep the faith Petra fans, the legacy begun by Bob Hartman is in good hands. One 'parting thought', to say that John Schlitt is the anti-christ is so asinine it is hardly worth mentioning, but after meeting him in person he is one of the most honest and personable people you would ever hope to meet. And besides how many guys pushing 50 can still belt out a rocker and a ballad like this guy?

review/text: When I saw all the negative reviews of this album I just had to say that I personally LOVE the new Petra album! It is different, which is good. Why would you re-do all your old songs the exact same way that you did them originally? Naturally, some people will not like the softened sound. I loved Petra when they were rocky. But I also love this album! The arrangements are brilliant! This Means War is really dramatic. Although I'm not a country fan, I like the very different take on Praying Man.After God Fixation's lack of success (both radio and sales), something needed to change. Thus the huge change in sound comes in the form of Double Take. This album will take people to get used to at first. But don't pass it by quickly. It is an excellent album with excellent music! I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Double Take is Petra at its Very Best and Very Worst
review/text: Petra in many ways pioneered the modern gospel music scene, and was one of the forerunners of the praise/rock style that later exploded onto the contemporary music scene in the late 1990s. After poor reviews and sales from 1998's &quot;God Fixation,&quot; Petra's current lineup decided to remake some of its biggest songs from the 1980s and early 1990s. To some this is the most misguided project Petra has ever undertaken, while others think it a masterful job of remaking the classics.I find the album has a bit of truth from both camps.Starting with their 1996 &quot;No Doubt&quot; tour, Petra inserted a half hour segment into their live show where the band would do a stripped down acoustic set of 5 or 6 &quot;classic&quot; Petra songs. The sound was simple, yet straighforward and the band was besieged by fans on whether they would release an album of these arrangements.While there will undoubtly be angry fans complaining about the lack of &quot;Rock&quot; on the album, the project was hyped as an acoustic &quot;unplugged&quot; album, not a traditional Petra effort.On the otherside, I'm somewhat disappointed that this is NOT a true unplugged set, but rather an album centered around frontman John Schlitt's powerful vocals and full orchestra.I enjoy when artists stretch themselves, and Petra hit and misses on several of the songs. &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; and &quot;Coloring Song&quot; have horrible production and the string arrangements ad nothing to the songs.However, the two selections, &quot;He Came, He Saw&quot; and &quot;This Means War&quot; are fantastic display of acoustic rock centered around the power of Schlitt's vocals and Louie Weaver's pounding drumming. Furthermore, both &quot;Creed&quot; and &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; allow the orchestra to compliment the band and not turn them into elevator music as on &quot;Just Reach Out&quot; (in which the original acoustic tune on &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; remains a masterpiece)Another thumbs up remake was &quot;Beat the System&quot;, in which the cheesey keyboards and whistles of the original are rearranged for a straightforward acoustic song. Unfornately, the two new songs &quot;The Longing&quot; and &quot;Breathe In&quot; fail to inspire, though the later's vocal arrangements are a new and appreciated touch.John Schlitt and Co. should be applauded for charting new waters, and remind fans that the charismatic front man, with the band since 1986, blows away his predecessor Greg X. Voltz in both stage presence and energy (to the Voltz worshipers, the guy hasn't exactly excelled as a solo artist, while Schlitt's powerful singing and concert energy is the big reason Petra devloped the following they did in the late 1980s)Overall, the album captures Petra on a artistic venture that has its highs in which the band recaptures some of its old glory and lows that makes it seem like the album's producer's should have put there foot down and force the band to go back to the drawing board.

review/text: It's amazing to see the reviews of so called &quot;fans&quot; of Petra really destroy this album or even humiliate the guys in Petra. Personally when I bought this album I really thought it was horrible BUT after listening to it a few times I really think this is great stuff. Why come out with a greatest hits when you can REWORK the old tunes into something different? No, it's not a rocker but you've got the old albums to listen to for that. Try something different. Petra isn't out of gas, they've refueled and are on their way back to the top. The songs to look out for are &quot;Dance&quot; &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; and &quot;Breath In&quot; featuring Pete Orta on lead vocals. John Schlitt is still one of the best lead singers in the world today. Buy this album and enjoy the ride that only Petra can take you on. GOD BLESS PETRA!

review/text: I'm a long-time Petra fan. I first gave my heart to the Lord during an altar call at a Petra concert, so some of the &quot;old&quot; songs have special meaning to me. When I heard they'd re-done some of the classics with a new sound, I was VERY skeptical. WOW. I was pleasantly STUNNED. I have to disagree with reviewer &quot;Tim&quot; on &quot;This Means War.&quot; Yes, I remember the pounding original version, but the new one is so haunting and ominous in a way, that the lyrics seem to really have even more impact. If you've read any of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, this version of &quot;...War&quot; will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Many of these songs are now 20 years old or so. The artists have lived that many more years, and they have changed like we all do. This was a chance to go back and re-work some things they'd done in the past. Wouldn't we all like to do that on certain things? And, with maturity, wouldn't our efforts be better for it? PETRA still ROCKS.

review/text: This was a nice change, kind of like Metallica's symphony and metal album. These are all classic Petra songs that every fan of Petra will recognize, however they have been reworked. The sound works, The label wanted them to do a mellower album than what they have done in the past, but this is the last one, so hopefully they will be able to hook up with a more supportive label. If you were expecting a Rocker this is not the album for you. I love the Rockin' Petra, but I really enjoy this one, with the exception of This means War. That was meant to be played at full volume with screaming guitar etc. Give this one a chance. I have been listening to it since I picked it up and have yet to tire of it!

review/text: I love this album. My first exposure to Petra was at the &quot;This Means War&quot; concert in Dallas about 13 years ago. All the songs are redone, with two new singles. At first I didn't like &quot;The Coloring Song&quot; off of this album, but it's growing on me by leaps and bounds. What really sold me was the new version of &quot;Beat The System&quot;. After having listened to one of the two new singles on this album, I must say that &quot;Breathe In&quot; is an incredible new song, catchy and intelligent, and I hope to hear more of that in the future. It takes a few times listening to the songs to really begin to enjoy the music. The music has many layers, without sounding obnoxious, and is a a result of well thought out producing, mastering and musicianship. Who knows? Maybe their recovery from &quot;God Fixation&quot; is just around the corner.

I don't really know WHAT the band was thinking, and I know John and Louie are getting old, but COME ON! At least put an Ubpeat sounding song on the thing! Judas Kiss was done pretty well in my opinion, as was Beyond Belief, Just Reach Out, and Dance. This Means War was done terribly! I can not believe that they mutilated This Means War in the fashion that they did. It sounds AWFUL! Everything else is ok, and the Coloring Song is reworked wonderfully. The two new songs on this album are really cool, too. However, the album does give off the impression that Petra is trying to emulate Jars of Clay or Caedmon's Call. Oh, yeah, if you liked John Schlitt's higher pitched vocals, do not get this album. He stays low the entire time.

review/text: It's what Sofia Coppola did for THE GODFATHER PART III.It's what Ewoks did for RETURN OF THE JEDI.It's what mascara does for Jan Crouch.It's what "MS Works" does for Microsoft.Well, that's what DOUBLE TAKE did for Petra. It may be the very worst album in contemporary Christian music history. This rehashing (murdering or butchering may be more accurate) of the classics from Petra's golden years (i.e. Volz) was just too much to take. It begins by destroying the immortal "The Coloring Song" and moves on from there to kill, maim, and destroy the classic rocker "Judas' Kiss".Not since the Imperials, has there been such a strong need to call it quits. Petra has had at least three lead singers (Rob Frazier, Greg X. Volz, and John Schlitt - I don't even know if he's still with them); long-time guitarist and songwriter Bob Hartman has retired (the last of the original members); and they have changed their "sound" multiple times within the last decade alone. As far as musical quality is concerned, is there anything left of the Petra that brought us MORE POWER TO YA or NOT OF THIS WORLD? How about even THIS MEANS WAR, UNSEEN POWER, or NO DOUBT? If a person from 1990 were to hear Petra today, would he/she recognize them as Petra?I'm not trying to be mean in this review. But what would you think about a major league baseball pitcher who was past his prime and yet kept on pitching just because he was one of the founding members of his team? Or a basketball player who was the best there ever was but kept on playing even though he was getting worse and worse every season? Wouldn't these guys hurt their team to keep on? Unfortunately, in the world of music, great bands have never been able to retire gracefully.

Mr Schlitt seems to have taken on the mantle of destroying whatever was left of the intergrity of this once great band. This album is dire. No more, no less. With insipid and lifeless versions of previous Peta classics, it is an example of down far downhill they have gone wince the glory days of Unseen Power et al.With the recent 'firing' of their long serving drummer for no aparant reason, I'm afraid that the writing is on the wall. A sad epitaph. This album says it all really.

But when I walked into the Christian bookstore &amp; saw it on the shelves in the music section, I seriously thought, &quot;Oh great; as if Petra doesn't already have enough 'best of' albums as it is.&quot; I took another look at it. I realized that the new recruits in the band as well as John &amp; Louie actually spent time in the studio recording (or rerecording, depending on your perspective) twelve songs. Yes, I know two of the twelve are new ones, but that's what artists do when they release a &quot;best of&quot; album: they add a bonus track or two for marketing. No surprise there. Now, I wasn't happy with &quot;Petra Praise 2&quot; (the first one had way more keyboards) and I really didn't flip over &quot;God Fixation&quot;. But I still have to give the guys credit. I did not expect them to release anything at all, so when I knew they did a full album, I had to tip my hat off to them. Personally (this is just my opinion &amp; taste in music) I feel like ever since their keyboardist John Lawry left in 1994, Petra has gone downhill musically. Yes, I know Bob Hartman is still writing their songs, but I'm talking about the way their songs sound. Now John Lawry is a full-time engineer in several recording studios, working constantly. I just wish Petra would bring back that &quot;big sound&quot; with the &quot;big keyboards&quot;. Oh, forgive me... I'm going on a rabbit trail here. I just know they have so much more potiental because it's already been shown (just not recently). Could do better. But will they? Only time will tell....

review/summary: This band needs to break it off NOW!
review/text: These guys have been around for way too long! I understand the need for this world to have strong ministry but lets face it. I grew up listening to Petra when I was 12 years old. Petra's third album Never Say Die had just came out and I was totally hooked on bands like Journey, Styx and Van Halen. When I heard Never Say Die I was completely enthralled. What a great album! That was only the beginning! Soon after, more classic albums would come-More Power to Ya (my personal favorite), Not of this World, Beat the System, Back to the Street, This Means War!, Beyond Belief and Unseen Power. All of these albums define a band that has inspired a generation of christians who happen to be musicians with a calling to innovate the christian music industry continuously. Could you imagine if Petra never existed? Not at all! Petra was the conduit of all commercialized christian rock in the 80's and 90's. I think it's their time to step off the pulpit and hand the batton to the Newsboys and Jars of Clay. Cheers.

review/text: Well, at first, I thought &quot;which band decided to pretend to be Petra?&quot; I went back and listened to some of the old stuff like Unseen Power ad Beyond Belief. After a while, I listened to &quot;Double Take&quot; again. I did not realize this at first, but the band is doing what they have done best throughout all thirty or so years: Adapting to what people are listening to in order that their message may reach the largest people. I do not believe they have turned into a money grabbing band anymore. Throughout the past few years dating back to &quot;No Doubt,&quot; they have had aproblem finding a style that fit the time as well as keeping players. However, after listening to this new sound of theirs, I believe they have found their niche for the next seven years or so. I have been a die-hard Petra fan for about ten years now...my tastes change in music, and people's tastes do change. Petra has a full tank of gas...they'll still be around. Oh yeah. For those of you that like Volz better, I happen to like Schlitt's vocals better with each album...he was better than Volz anyway.

review/summary: Not bad, but could have been better
review/text: Don't get me wrong. I go nuts when I hear someone say the WORD Petra. Anyway, they are my favorite group. I like all their music basically from 79-98. This album and the first two were my least favorites. But I still like some songs on this album, like &quot;Praying Man&quot; and &quot;Judas' Kiss&quot; ... which I think were CLASSIC remakes. And &quot;He Came,He Saw&quot; wasn't bad. I also like &quot;Breathe In&quot; sung by Pete Orta, the lead guitarist for Petra. I have a website for Petra,which is also owned by my friend Billy too. I went to the Boston, MA concert and it ROCKED. This album was just made for the new generation to get a chance to experience Petra and all their great songs with EXCEPTIONAL lyrics today in 2000. I love the ROCK albums like ON FIRE! and UNSEEN POWER, but I'd give this 4 stars, 3 of which because it wasn't as bad. And I gave 1 more because John is singing. Yes, JOHN. He has the BEST 80's HARD ROCK voice ever. And he has a POWERFUL voice for ballads and soft songs too. Greg was good too. I think the best ballad I have heard in a WHILE is &quot;The Longing&quot;. It has a REALLY good message. I like about 1/2 the songs on this album, so for me it's worth it to add it to my collection and play the songs in my CD player once in a while. CREED, COLORING SONG, DANCE, and JUST REACH OUT where probably my least favorite, but I'm sure acoustic rock/contemporary music lovers will like it. This was just a ONE TIME album, and the best part about it is that the lead singer John Schlitt has told us that the next album is gonna be a ROCKER! So don't lose hope, die hard Petra fans! I can't wait!

review/text: I've always loved Petra, I've gone through many changes with them, and continued to love them. This new album is a step in the wrong direction in my opinion. I want so bad to find something to like in it,but there's nothing there. &quot;Dance&quot; was the only song that I found even somewhat acceptable, but it still pales in comparison to the hard-rocking original. This one goes to the very bottom of my Petra collection, maybe if I ignore it, it will go away. Go with &quot;God Fixation,&quot; if you want an example of the Petra that I still love.

review/text: My husband of nearly 11 years has loved Petra since before I knew him - collecting albums, going to concerts, playing his cassettes until they were worn out, etc. This album he THREW IN THE TRASH!!! The songs chosen for this album are Petra classics, yet they ruined them in our opinion. The remade versions change the style of the music so you can hardly tell it is Petra. If you love the original songs, you will likely not like these versions. My suggestion: listen to the excerpts and see for yourself.

review/text: Ok, I've listened to a lot of the old petra albums and really enjoyed them. So when I saw Double Take I decided to buy it. I was very surprised to find that petra removed the electric guitar from this album and substituted a classical guitar. While the songs are still good, this album doesn't sound like the old Petra. Consequently, most people who loved the old Petra sound won't appreciate this album.

review/summary: Tragic
review/text: This album astounds me. What possible motivation could Petra (or maybe just Bob?) have had to record this? Here's a message to the guys in the band from a long (and I mean long) time fan: If you want to write NEW songs, write new songs. Don't completely rebuild old songs. There is a reason that people liked the originals. For instance, the tune &quot;Beat The System&quot; bears only a passing resemblence to the original. The hooks are all gone, stripping the song down to a disjointed mess. If Petra's goal was to make some old classics less &quot;catchy,&quot; mission accomplished. Put it this way, this disk is enough to make me think twice about buying the next one (and I've been a pretty hard-core fan for almost twenty years)!

review/summary: Another great album from a great band!
review/text: This new album from Petra is great! It is really different, and I love that! I'm very glad they didn't do another greatest hits album, but decided to give us a different perspective on the songs! These staples of Petra's repertoire still contain the same anointing as when they were brand new, only in a different style. Because they have been doing this for so long, people have decided Petra only fit in a certain box. (Just look at these reviews to see what I mean!) Still, a lot of Petra fans, including me, have gone nuts over this album! As any normal band wanting to live on would do, Petra are trying to reach out to younger audiences, as well as long-time listeners and maybe even people who haven't been listening to Petra at all before because of having a very narrow view of the style of music they play. You've got to expect the unexpected with Petra. If they always did what was considered `normal' they wouldn't have lasted 27 years! Luckily,we all like different types of music. I know for a fact that their next album will be a rocker. Let's just enjoy the fact that Petra are full of surprises! I really recommend this album for everyone!

review/summary: FINALLY! DIONNE'S ARISTA SINGLES ON A SINGLE CD!
review/text: This Japanese release, &quot;Best 19&quot; by Dionne Warwick, spans the years 1979-1987 when she was signed with Arista Records. Included here are her biggest Arista hits--&quot;I'll Never Love This Way Again,&quot; &quot;Deja Vu,&quot; &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; &quot;That's What Friends Are For&quot; and &quot;Love Power&quot; (with Jeffrey Osborne)--and also most of her additional singles released by the label. That's what I love most about this collection: it's pretty comprehensive! Tracks such as &quot;After You,&quot; &quot;No Night So Long,&quot; &quot;Easy Love,&quot; &quot;Friends In Love&quot; (with Johnny Mathis), &quot;Take The Short Way Home,&quot; &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot;(with Luther Vandross), &quot;Whisper In The Dark&quot; and &quot;Reservations For Two&quot; were also hits for Dionne, receiving substantial airplay on pop and adult contemporary radio stations in the early to mid '80s. The only omissions that keep this set from being a complete single-to-single collection from this period are &quot;For You,&quot; &quot;Got A Date,&quot; &quot;Finder Of Lost Loves&quot; (with Glenn Jones) and &quot;Run To Me&quot; (with Barry Manilow). However, these are lesser-known releases and you might not miss them anyway.If you love Dionne Warwick, and you've been trying to find the hits from the second half of her long career, get this import CD &quot;Best 19.&quot; (This compilation of hits FAR SURPASSES the ridiculous U.S. release &quot;Greatest Hits 1979-1990&quot; which is padded with several non-singles and, therefore non-hits.)&quot;Best&quot; regards--Top 40 Todd

I STILL love it. While I love all of Sammy's solo stuff, the classic stuff still gives me goose bumps. I don't know if it is the memories of my youth, and the hours of air guitar fun I had, or just the pure adrenalin, party fun rock and roll that he always captures. His early stuff is so amazing, and yet so underrated. Don't get me wrong, I love Van Halen, but I pull out classic Sammy like this much faster and more frequently than I do the Van Hagar stuff. Life before (and after) VH is so much sweeter in so many ways.

review/text: This was my first introduction to the Red Rocker, and I was hooked for life.For those who consider themselves one of Sam's hardcores as I do, this is arguably his best piece of work.Sammy surrounded his all time classic &quot;Plain Jane&quot; with many more memorable jams such as &quot;Trans Am&quot;, &quot;Feels Like Love&quot; and &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. Sam also shows his heart with two gripping songs that let you know what he's all about, &quot;Child to Man&quot; and &quot;Never Say Die&quot;. Closing out he leaves you with the all to accurate prediction for the future, going &quot;Straight to the Top&quot;.For those who want to get a taste of what Sam was doing pre-80's, then this is the best place to start.

review/summary: One Of Sammy Hagar's Best From His Early Years
review/text: STREET MACHINE is one of Sammy Hagar's best albums from the early part of his career, blending such influences as Ted Nugent and the Outlaws, with many great songs to boot. The highlight of this CD is the cautionary "This Planet's On Fire (Burn In Hell)", but that doesn't take away from the power of such songs as the slashing rocker "Trans Am (Highway Wonderland)" and the sensitive midtempo number "Plain Jane." Hagar's advocacies of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, increased funding for law enforcement/community policing, and capital punishment or life without parole for kidnappers make STREET MACHINE an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.

review/text: In high school EVERYONE wanted a trans am. "sits 10" off the ground with a custom plate..." Kind of a silly song, but it will pump you up! Plain Jane is my favorite SH tune of all time. My buddies and I cranked this tune up until there was nothing but distortion on the way to school in my nova. Street Machine is not his best work, however if you listen to the words of "Never Say Die" you can capture some of the struggles we go through in early adulthood. So go and crank up T-R-A-N-S A-M and feel like a kid again.

review/text: Gosh, this movie was so lame and so ridiculous. There was no suspense, no thrill at all, and not for one second was I hooked to this movie. The whole premise of the movie is screwed up. The kids' parent's die, and the guardians they're forced to live with are only after their money (not to mention psycho), so they're basically killed. What was the point of this all?

review/summary: Wow haha...
review/text: I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I was looking for some good movies to watch and I saw this one. Eh.. not what I expected.From the front, it looks like it'll be a super scary, awesome movie.Undoubtedly it was good at parts, and the acting was pretty good, but... it was one of those kind of movies where you are watching the movie and you start yelling at the screen, "No! No, don't do that! Jeez, you- no! I can't believe she did that... Idiot." Like, if you know the killer's in the dark room and they go into the dark room anyways because they lost their cat or something...?I actually found myself calling the main character an idiot more than once. When the kids (not to give away the plot) get out of the basement, they go and get the keys to the car to get away. Personally, I would have hightailed it out of there and ran as fast as possible away. Secondly, when Ruby sees (spoilers) Erin dead, wouldn't you think she'd call 911? But nope, she doesn't. Thirdly, the girl is 16 years old; she is taking a Drivers Ed class. You'd think she'd at least know a LITTLE bit about driving... in the scene where she's taking her brother away with her and it's raining, she drives like a little kid! Sure she was only in the class for a little while, and she did say she was a bad driver, but seriously?All in all, if you and your friends wanna pop something in to watch and you feel like making fun of the character's stupid mistakes, go right on ahead and watch! We all need those movies from time to time, you know? I'm not being sarcastic when I say that, by the way.I did give it two stars, though, because it did make me jump and gasp a few times. I always love movies that can genuinely make me gasp or jump. :) It's not a bad movie, it just could have been directed better.

review/summary: Let's jump off the Sierras
review/text: A simple thriller like so many others. A car accident, two orphans sheltered by the parents' business associates who are revealed to have been the killers to put their hands on the money the children represent, and all that for some shady business with criminal contractors. Banal. The elder child, the girl, will try to escape and will fail. And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family. The thrill comes from the details of the yarn we are told which is in a way a tall tale from some Calaveras County, California and its giant leaping jumping frogs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

review/text: Well first let me say that Leelee Sobieski is one of my favorite actresses. Today I found out that I'm not the only one who thinks she looks just like Helen Hunt! Well anyways it was a great movie with a wery well written plot. The cinematography was done well also. The reflections of the water in the glass make the movie creepy and help to biuld the suspense. At many ponts in the movie you think someone is going to jump out and grab Ruby (Leelee Sobieski's character). Well if you're looking for a great renter or buyer, get this DVD.

review/summary: Leering at Leelee-Let us count the ways
review/text: ... The young actress who made her mark ...in "Eyes Wide Shut" has now become more voluptuous, and Hollywood is apparantly full speed ahead in getting her wet and unclothed in "serious" movies.I am giving away no plot by saying this is one of those films where the main characters are put into a new situation that turns out to be menacing. Usually, these films show things going fine, and small things start happening to make the heroes start wondering what they got themselves into. This movie doesn't waste time with such formalities.The plot concerns a slilghtly rebellious teenager and her younger brother all of a sudden becoming orphans. They are immediately given sympathetic offers of help from all sides by various relatives and acquaintences. Problem is that each offer seems to come with a leering or menacing look from the offerer, which naturally makes her more uncomfortable.For whatever reason, they choose to come live with a couple who seem to be a friend of the family, even after getting an offer from a blood relative. Maybe it's because the friends of the family live in a multi-million, state-of-the-art, everything-always-in-its-place ...[sea-side] mansion. But instead of at least appearing like a decent deal from the beginning, the couple seems creepy right from the start. ...And the couple is not just plain creepy. They are domineering, self destructive creeps who are pretty much portrayed as evil from day one. This could still possibly work in a movie if they would have brought in some buckets of horror and terror a lot earlier into the movie. But it doesn't. ...... If they wanted to make a good movie, it should have been a lot more intense a lot quicker, and they should have kept the intensity throughout. But they took it easy, and figured if you are content to watch a nineteen-year-old play a sixteen-year-old, you'll buy a ticket.

The music score by Christopher Young is perfect. Also, the direction and production design were both utterly beautiful, to say the least.Congrats to the director, cast, and crew for a solid thriller!

review/summary: More than Half Empty
review/text: "Run of the mill" was a term I kept thinking while watching THE GLASS HOUSE. By the time it reaches its CAPE FEAR finale (where the villain appears to survive everything to remain a threat), I'd lost interest in the story--mainly because the characters weren't very interesting to begin with.Leelee Sobieski is a hot teen girl. She looks great in a bikini, looks great standing around, just looks great. But there's really nothing to her character to distinguish her from any other teenage girl. She's sympathetic because she's...hot. (She's certainly not very good at eavesdropping since she gets caught every single time).You know what might have made this movie more interesting? Leelee actually begins to have feelings for her new guardian, Stellan Skarsgard. He charms her, pulls her in, draws her out of her depression over the death of her parents (imagine the betrayal that sets up!). But his character is so slimy and creepy that I'm surprised he wasn't wearing a hockey mask or even a black stovepipe hat with a black moustache from his first scene. Everything is so undeveloped and by-the-numbers that nothing is a surprise.Diane Lane and Bruce Dern are around but the movie wastes their considerable talents.When it's over, you're left with...okay...that's it, huh?

review/text: Being a fan of both Leelee Sobieski and Diane Lane; I figured I had to see ths movie. that and I do enjoy the predictable B-movie from time to time!That being said, that is exactly what this movie is, a predictable (but funny) B-movie. In all honesty, the script isn't half bad, and the acting is one thing that svaes this movie as a whole. the one draw back is the fact that it is so predictable. As someone has mentioned it seems to be more like a made-for-tv movie instead of a big-budget suspenseful thriller.The acting as I mentioned is one thing that isn't half bad in this movie. Diane Lane as always puts on her best performance even with a lackluster script. Leelee Sobieski, who seems to always come under fire from both fans and critics alike, also puts on a super performance and shows she can hold her own alongside an actress like Diane Lane.So yes, while the movie is predictable, and it has scenes that even may be highly unbelievable; it is a good movie to just sit and enjoy. You can even get involved yourself; yelling at the screen and asking why certain charcters are dumb enough to do certain things!I do recommend this movie for a good time, and when it comes to Leelee Sobieski you can't go wrong.

review/summary: A medicore to good thriller to watch on a lazy afternoon
review/text: The general concept of this film sounds great. Two orphaned teenagers parents are tragically killed in an automobile accident, and so they go to live with old friends of their parents. This was the first mistake. What would have been better is if they would have gone to live with a couple that were completely unrelated or unknown to them. Both the teeangers have trust funds or something of that nature set up for them however they cannot claim it until they are adults. Ultimately, the plan of the foster parents is to kill them so they can get the money that was left to them. Apparently, the foster parents (the Glass's) have a lot of debts. Mrs. Glass has a drug addiction while Mr. Glass owes a lot of money to some seedy loan sharks. That was the second mistake of this film because it led to a very dismal ending. Their purpose for trying to kill the children should not have been to pay off debts or something typical like that. How about they are just trying to kill the children because they are selfishly greedy and want a lot more money than they already have and that's it? That would have made the characters a lot more sinister and evil making for a more effective thriller. Although that probably would have been considered too "dark" for people to handle. The ending does get pretty ridiculous. The first two-thirds of the film are pretty decent, but the last third of the movie is a big let-down. This could have been much better had minor changes been made and the ending totally revamped into something more satisfying. It would have been fun if they had included a chase scene throughout that big glass house.

review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed The Glass House. The film has some of the usual cliches in the genre. People popping out of dark corners, people hiding in obvious locations (like under the bed) and not getting caught, people coming back to life after getting mutilated a couple thousand times. But for some reason, I really got into the film and was able to look over those cliches, and I actually didn't think much of them. It is not a classic and is somewhat predictable, but it is sufficiently engrossing and effective to hold interest.All in all, The Glass House is well-worth the money, whether you rent it or buy it.

Truly, she is a great young talent in Hollywood.I could not give it a five however, because there were some isolated incidents that I felt lacked creativity. Yet, I don't believe that it detracted from the movie enough to make it unenjoyable.Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan of &quot;The Patriot&quot;) are orphaned after a car accident claims their parent's lives. Ruby finds out that she and Rhett will be living with old family friends, the Glass'. But as they start settling in, she discovers that with the glamorous glass house in Malibu comes a nightmare that will endanger her and her brother's life.

review/summary: Great thriller, great DVD!
review/text: Ever since I first saw THE GLASS HOUSE at my local cinema, I have grown a new appreciation for suspense movies. I see how everything is important in making the audience scared (the atmosphere, the lighting, the music, etc.). It certainly is an entertaining and scary movie, and now it has a great DVD edition to go with it.Honestly, you couldn't have picked a better cast. As she has proved many times, Leelee Sobieski is one of the best young actresses in the biz. Diane Lane &amp; Stellan Skarsgrd are great as the ruthless Glasses. Trevor Morgan is fun as Rhett, Sobieski's brother in the film. There are also several amusing appearances by Bruce Dern, Kathy Baker, Chris Noth, Michael O'Keefe, and Rita Wilson (who, for some reason, is not billed in the credits).Daniel Sackheim (director), Alar Kivilo (d.o.p.), and Christopher Young (composer), as well as the cast &amp; the rest of the creative/productive staff, all worked very hard to make THE GLASS HOUSE an intriguing, suspenseful, and beautifully-made thriller.DVD Special Features: director and writer commentary, deleted scenes, exclusive filmmaker interviews, trailers, filmographies, production notes, and scene selections.

review/summary: THE TRANSPARENT MAN AND WIFE
review/text: THE GLASS HOUSE is metaphorically interesting: not only is the physical building mostly glass, but the owners of the house are Terry and Erin Glass. Into this pristine setting come two youngsters whose parents were tragically killed in an automobile accident. In their will, they stated they wanted their old friends, the Glasses, to look after them. All is not what it seems at first and soon a more incendiary plot is revealed.What I really liked most about this film is the precisioned and passionated performance by Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride). This young actress is not only a lovely woman, but she seemed to understand the nuances of her role and even as it plummets into shameless melodrama by the end, Leelee stays with it and elevates it above what it could have been under someone else's control. Diane Lane foreshadowed her work in UNFAITHFUL in her role as the addicted physician, although her role gets backseat most of the time. Young Trevor Morgan is very good as the eleven year old, and Stellan Skarsgard, while menacing and vile, never seemed to fully show us his greed and nastiness. Cameo-type roles are taken by Chris Noth as the children's distant uncle; and Michael O'Keefe and an uncredited Rita Wilson as the doomed parents.Moody and manipulative, THE GLASS HOUSE nonetheless entertains and it's mostly because of Leelee.

review/summary: "SOOO suspensful!".............(chuckle)
review/text: Sorry for the opening sarcasm, but I rented this one from pay-per-view, taping it as I usually do. I was expecting a great film with superb acting. Well, the acting was superb, with Diane Lane, the ever hottie she is ;-), doing another fantastic job as a drugged-out motherless wife. Her hubby, as it turns out, is in over his head with some mobster types. Well, they bring in some kids who have just lost their parents to a tragic..."accident", and have taken guardianship of them. Of course, our lovely couple really wants the money that was left to the kids and then.......I was left holding the remote, aimlessly watching the credits role before my eyes, thinking I would have been better off having watched another one of ESPN's 'Sports Century' or even E's 'Wild On'...well, that last one might be a stretch.In all fairness, Leelee(such a fun name) Sobieski is convincing and Diane Lane, well she's flat out hot. The plot, however, is pure nonesense. Of course, this is just my opinion. You might be one of those people who watches it, enjoys it, and places it on the movie shelf right next to Wild Things and Cruel Intentions.Go in peace, my children, go in peace.

review/text: This movie is the 21st centuries version of a &quot;B&quot; rated movie. It is entirely predictable and not very thrilling for being a mystery thriller movie. The acting, well, I hope these actors don't quit their real jobs. You guess the ending before it's over. I would certainly NOT waste $ to purchase this movie.

review/summary: Bad with a capital B.
review/text: I expected The Glass House to deliver a suspenseful clever twisting and turning of events amidist creepy adoptive parents. Well...the creepy parents was the only thing we got. LeeLee Sobieski is as stiff as an ironing board, most of the time seeming too embarrassed about taking the role to function properly. The plot seemed great, but the story's twists and turns could have been thought of by a 3rd grade classroom...and they frankly make our heroine look as dumb as a brick. How did this girl not figure out that the lawyer was giving up information to the adoptive family? Hello...earth to Leelee. Some of it was meant to be exploitative...like her swimming in the pool in a ridiculous bikini...or the secretary at the office. No matter, the ending was an anti-climax. But it was all pretty bad.

review/summary: A Great Mesmerizing Thriller
review/text: The Glass House is one great movie by a beginning director, Daniel Sackheim. Every shot is so perfectly smooth and perfect in every way. I love when the house is dark becuase it adds to the mystery. This film had a great cast. Ruby(LeeLee Sobieski), Rhett(Trevor Morgan), Terry Glass(Stellan Skarsgard), and Erin Glass(Diane Lane). Leelee Sobieski is a great rising actress who is sure to reach the top one day. Trevor Morgan is also pretty good who starred in Jurassic Park 3 and The Patriot.The DVD is pretty good but I was disappointed because there was only one deleted scence and deleted scenes are always my favorite to watch. The picture is perfectly clear throughout the whole movie and the sound is so amazingly great is unbelieveable to your ears.The movie is about the Baker Family. They are ovioulsy a loving family and a family like everyone else. Mr. and Mrs. Baker are a loving couple who care so much about their kids. Ruby and Rhett Baker are like any other kids. They fight. Ruby and her friends stay out at night and Ruby smokes behind her parents back. The night of her parents anniversy Ruby is out late again. When she steps out of the car she smells like smoke so she sprays herself with perfume. When she turns the corner to her house she sees police. She automaticlly thinks her parents called them because they were worried about her. In her house she finds out that her parents were in a car crash and they died. After hearing all this she faints from shock and horror.It then shows her at their funeral. When the priest is done speaking he lets Rhett say a few words but Rhett breaks sown in tears. The Glasses rush up to assist him and Mr. Glass talks about the Bakers for a minute. When outside Ruby is approached by their Uncle Jack who they haven't seen since they were kids. He says that if they ever need any help they can just call him. When Ruby gets home she talks with Mr. Alvin Begleiter who was their parents trust agent. He says that her parents said that if anything ever happend to them that they would trust the Glasses to take care of them. He gives Ruby his card then leaves as Mr. Glass enters. Ruby thanks Mr. Glass. In the nxt scene Ruby and Rhett are moving out of their house to go live with the Glasses. When they arrive at the Glasses house they are surprised. Their house is huge and almost everything is glass. When they are shown their room they are sort of disappointed because they have to share a room. But they get over it because at least the Glasses accepted them.As the movie goes on Ruby finds out horrible things about the Glasses. She discovers their terrible secrets and gets really nervous and afraid. I don't want to tell you anymore because this movie is so phenomehaly great. I'll gurantee you will love this movie.

review/summary: Some people are too picky!
review/text: I thought THE GLASS HOUSE was first-class suspense, as far as teen flicks go. A lot of people like to critize films like these. So what if the trailers gave away too much of the film? That shouldn't give you any reason to hate it or not to go see it...you can't judge a film by it's trailer! Besides, it's mainly for entertainment and enjoyment, period. That's what Hollywood is for, right? THE GLASS HOUSE is about a teenage girl named Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) who lives with her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), and their parents in LA. When Ruby comes home one night to find out her parents died in a car accident, she and her brother are sent to live with the Glasses', their parents' best friends who live in Maliabu. They move into the Glasses' strange creepy mansion which is made out of glass. Soon, Ruby starts to notice that the guardians aren't what they seem to be...and things start getting even stranger when the Glasses' want Ruby and her brother dead!I thought THE GLASS HOUSE was an excellent film. I definitely want to go see this a second time and I'm planning on buying it when it comes out on DVD. All the actors are truly amazing and talented, especially Diane Lane (who is excellent in all her films), Leelee Sobieski, and Trevor Morgan. The special effects were pretty fantastic, and the whole film was just creepy and full of suspense! It kept me glued to the edge of my seat the entire time - I never once took my eyes off the screen! There are also some surprising twists that pop up in the film that were not given away in the trailer or previews. I'm not going to be the one to give any of them away so all I can say is please go see this film! It's totally worth your money and it's definitely one of the best films of the fall. Go see THE GLASS HOUSE and you won't be disappointed! :-)

review/summary: Suspenseful, but Predictable.
review/text: From the looks of the trailer, &quot;The Glass House&quot; looks really scary. Well, just to let you know, it's not. It was dropped in the &quot;thriller&quot; genre, but is not much of one at all. It has a lot of almost getting caught sneaking around type stuff. That is one disappointment. The other is how predictable everything is. I mean, I guessed everything correctly through the whole movie. Oh, well. The script is not as bad as some critics like to say it is. The acting is pretty good too. Leelee Sobieski (&quot;Joan of Arc,&quot; &quot;Here on Earth,&quot; &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; and in the upcoming thriller &quot;Joy Ride&quot;) who plays the main character, Ruby, does a superb job as always. The young actress is quite a beauty and is even considered the spitting image of Helen Hunt. If you like tense, almost to the edge-of-your-seat scenes, this movie is for you. If you don't like that kind of stuff, see &quot;Hardball.&quot; 13 and over for violence, some language, drug use, brief sexual suggestions, and sinister thematic elements.

review/summary: In Case Of Emergency: Break Glass...
review/text: THE GLASS HOUSE is one of the better PG-13 thrillers out there. It has some actual suspense and never stoops to being a typical teen movie. Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride) is excellent in the role of Ruby, a girl who finds herself without parents after a fatal car crash. She and her brother (Trevor Morgan from Jurassic Park 3) must live with their godparents, Terry (Stellan "Bootstrap Bill" Skarsgard) and Erin (Diane Lane) Glass. At first, everything seems fine, until Ruby begins noticing some increasingly unsettling goings-on. Of course, this leads to dark revelations and catastrophic events! TGH is full of mystery, tension, and plenty of creepy pseudo-parenting. Skarsgard is quite convincing in his slimy persona, and Ms. Lane is dependable as always. Also, watch for Bruce Dern (Silent Running, The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant) and Kathy Baker (Edward Scissorhands) as a lawyer and a socialworker respectively...

review/summary: Trust can be as transparent as glass...
review/text: This is a lesson that Ruby and Rhett (Leelee Sobieski & Trevor Morgan) learn soon after the death of their parents and they are sent to live with neighbors Terrence and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgrd & Diane Lane). Things aren't as they seem in the Glass's glass home, which is pretty cool. The point of the film being that trust is transparent and so a glass house is used to represent that beings that everything is easily seen and heard, much like the underlying plot twists which are easily seen and heard before we, the veiwer, should know them. That's the problem here is the predictability, but then again, even with predictability it still packs a punch. This isn't the best thriller to come out by far, but Skarsgrd makes for a believable and quite scary villian. So Ruby and Rhett realize, Ruby first, that the Glass's are using them for their inheritance which comes up to about $4 million dollars and this spirals into a game of cat and mouse that is a bit intense, thanks to Skarsgrd's verosity. All in all I give it 3 1/2 stars because it really tries to be something better, it just falls short of the mark, but not so short it's unworthy of a watch through.

review/summary: Great movie!
review/text: I saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention, because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses, (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet, buy it! It's well worth your while!

review/summary: You've seen better
review/text: This film had an interesting premise. The cast was promising. The Glass House seemed like a fairly interesting little film.It was interesting in a disappointing sort of way. While the DVD quality was good, the actual quality of the story leaves much to be desired. The performances are OK, but the story waivers and is inconsistent, and doesn't adequately set you up for a lot of the plot points. In terms of a thriller, there are definitely WAY better choices out there. And a lot of questions aren't really answered effectively, so the plot can't chug along in the manner intended. That being said...you see the outcome a MILE away. But The Glass House just doesn't delivery in terms of a strong, well-constructed story that hums along and packs a punch in the thrills department.Really...watch this if you are forced to only. It's just a waste of time otherwise.

review/text: I was hooked on the trailer, and I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, the best part of the film WAS the trailer. My problem with the movie was the convenient moments of incredibly nonsensical behavior. Just when a bit of tension was building, our heroine fails us. I watched the movie with a group of 12 friends, and we all were shouting at the film at the same times. &quot;Duh... call the police!&quot; &quot;Um, could you be any more obvious?&quot; By the latter part of the film, we were all cheering the bad guys on. Our reason? &quot;Anyone doing things that stupid deserves to get whacked.&quot;Bottom line - Revved the engines but failed to engage the gears.

review/summary: Despite revealing previews, &quot;The Glass House&quot; delivers.
review/text: Trailers say too much about their movies these days, giving away too many secrets so that any impact the actual film will have is weakened. &quot;The Glass House&quot; is no exception, but while the trailer lets us in on the movie's secrets, the suspense behind them comes out unscathed. You may know what will happen, but getting there is quite a ride in this uniquely stylish teenage thriller.The film stars Leelee Sobieski as Ruby Baker, who lives like any typical teenager going to prep school in Los Angeles and sneaking out of her house at night. On the night of her parents' 20th wedding anniversary, she comes home to discover them killed in a car wreck, leaving her and her young brother Rhett in the care of their former next-door neighbors, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane). Soon after the funeral, it's off the Malibu, and the beginning of a whole new life.The Glass house itself is made up of much glass, inside and out, providing a creepy atmosphere where things are constantly uneasy. From the get-go, Ruby gets the feeling that she is being watched, and the fact that her new guardians continuously shower them with gifts seems more like a purchase of their trust. As the months go by, things begin to lose their luster: Terry begins to make not-so-subtle passes at Ruby, whose quest for information surrounding the death of her parents leads her to believe that her new caretakers may have played a part in the accident.Due to the revelations the trailer makes, the movie loses its surprise factor, something it considerably suffers from. It gives away the fact that the Glasses are out to attain the childrens' inheritance to pay off loan sharks, therefore diminishing the effect this would have had it been left a surprise. Not only that, but it gives away many plot twists, including the finale, which begins by denying the heroine the right to take part in the final confrontation, and then resurrects the villain once more so that she can.Still, I found much of the film to be fitfully interesting, due to the level of suspense the movie is able to achieve. Ruby's search for clues provides some very tense moments, such as a scene in which she sends an email to her parents' former legal consultant, only to discover the next day that her AOL account is closed. Was it closed by Terry, or because the account was not paid off due to her parents' death? Terry also provides her with an English report that she believes is his original work, though it turns out to be that of a published author, landing her in the hot seat at school.Scenes like these manage to create a sense of slight psychological fear, while resurrecting the movie from a certain downfall. The movie also hits a high note by sticking to slow-building suspense rather than cheap shocks. So many teenage thrillers latch on to the old-school tricks of bloody gore and quick jumps, but &quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to create an atmosphere that gets under your skin just enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for much of the story.The cast also brings the movie to a high point, featuring commendable performances all around. Leelee Sobieski rises above most actresses her age, instilling a bravery and strength in her character that makes her strong and believable. Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard are fitfully mysterious as the Glasses, and, in some cases, almost spine-tingling. The interaction between the cast makes a sometimes silly story easy to stomach, especially the film's final resolution.&quot;The Glass House&quot; manages to stray from the usual violent gore and gruesome bloodshed that permeates many modern teenage thrillers, and gives us a story that provides some good suspense and fine performances. The trailer is a giveaway, though, and will diminish most of the film's effect for those who like to be left in the dark. But, put that aside, and you'll find that there's more to this movie than its previews reveal.

review/summary: Leelee (primarily) and Skarsgaard make this worth watching at the very least
review/text: I must confess, I can't think of too much to say on the topic of The Glass House. It's certainly not a horrible movie; it's a decent film though. The story line was actually fairly decent regardless of how implausible, but I don't usually go to the movies to see reality, I exist in reality and I know what it's like. If I want reality I watch documentaries. Anyway, I have tried to curb my overwhelming bias for Leelee Sobieski in my rating. She's one of the three actresses I simply adore looking at and watching in general. So it really didn't matter if the rest the cast wasn't very good, I probably would've enjoyed watching it anyway... yes, I did try to curb this bias in my rating and look at the movie as a whole.The basic premise of the film is based around two kids, Ruby Baker (Leelee) and her brother, which inherited a lot of money from their dead parents. Their guardian, Terry Glass (Skarsgaard), (unbeknownst to others) borrowed a lot of money from loan sharks, so now he wants the kids' money to pay it off. He tries to weasel his way through the movie to get the cash any way he can. The movie is classified as a suspense/thriller, so I'm assuming people can guess where that all goes towards the end. It's actually a lot better than the quick overview sounds and a lot of this has to do with the interaction between Sobieski and Skarsgaard, who, in my opinion, gave the best performances in the film. Luckily most of film is centered on them, and thus, the general lack of the other characters is made up for.Her brother was incredibly annoying throughout the film, but he was supposed to play the role of the annoying little brother, so I suppose he succeeded. For some reason I just plain wasn't into his acting, it felt kind of forced a lot of the times (then again, he is young and not a major character). Terry's wife, played by Diane Lane, simply listlessly goes through this film, which, again, I think her character was supposed to do. She wasn't a major presence in the film so her presence didn't get annoying, but at least her acting performance was more convincing. I will say that I did enjoy the end of the movie. It was only semi-expected on my behalf. I kind of figured out what would happen by the end, but the way they executed it was actually pretty interesting, so it definitely didn't disappoint on that level.I don't think anyone would consider this one of the best movies ever, but I think most people will find some general merit in it. It's a pretty decent story that keeps you interested throughout the whole movie with a good amount of intrigue to keep you guessing at some things during the film. And if none of that really gets you there's a solid five minute scene of Leelee swimming in a pool in a pretty small bikini. That alone has to be worth at least one or two stars in my book. Coupled with the fact that there is a scene with her in just her bra right before this! A good time in itself, I say. Sorry... the bias came through there, I couldn't help it. Anyway, not a top priority movie, but definitely worth watching if it's on, or picking it up used for under five bucks. It does have some re-watch value, but not a ton, I think the few times I've watched this it has been years apart... definitely worth seeing once at the very least though.

review/summary: Two Very Nice Performances
review/text: "The Glass House" (2001) is one of those films that you enjoy during the viewing thanks to good directing, good technical film-making (production design-nicely staged action sequences-odd camera angles), and convincing dialogue; but look back at feeling generally dissatisfied. In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary.The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up.For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside "The Glass House"; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a "glass" house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows.There are several references to "Hamlet" with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet's point of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor.The film opens with a "film within a film" device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the "nothing is what it seems to be" theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly know that they are odd because the director works so hard to make them appear normal.Ruby and her little brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with the Glass's in their expensive hilltop house. Can you say: "Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage"? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been got lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it was originally included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows.From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements.Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

review/text: I found this movie to be scary, but there was no mystery involved. I could tell, from the beginning, what was going on. There is one point in the movie when I thought maybe it was just the girl being suspicious. It may be too much for soneone who is too sensitive to see children in danger. It is a fair (in quality) movie. I have no intention of watching it again.

review/summary: Predictable yet entertaining
review/text: There was a missing element in this supposed thriller. The mystery was all but completely obvious, and even then our heroine, Ruby, goes mainly on suspicion and eavesdropping. Her sleuthing skills are minimal and I felt the process of discovery was forced, random, and left much to be desired. A thriller slowly and steadily reveals the predicament the victim is in rather than have it, literally, walk right through the front door. You basically dislike and suspect the antagonists from the beginning so it's no shock when things start to go downhill.Much of the story is predictable, but the suspense is still exciting. I wish the back story of the Glass' was developed better. The culmination of multiple threads at the end is satisfying and creative.My criticism out of the way, the acting was actually very good and the suspense had me on the edge of my seat. So for pure entertainment value, this was acceptable. And Leelee is excellent as the moody teenage heroine playing Ruby with the right amount of suspicion, arrogance, and ignorance.

review/text: THE GLASS HOUSE is about a girl and her brother and they get adopted by their neighbours because their parents died in a car accident. Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby (that girl) and she's your typical high school student. After Ruby and her brother move in with their new guardians (the Glasses) they start to notice some weird things about them. That's all i'm saying about the plot. THE GLASS HOUSE is suprisingly bland. It offers no suspense, a mediocre storyline, predictable plot -- shall I go on? It was boring OK! It could've been a &quot;made for TV movie&quot; or one that goes straight to video. It should be collecting dust on the shelves soon.

review/text: At a glance, this film would appear to have a nice Hitchcockian plot, filled with suspense and doubt. However, even the intial setup winds up being clunky and nonsensical, while the rest of the film see-saws between laughably ridiculous and painfully dull. Though Leelee Sobieski, Stellan Skaarsgard, and Diane Lane all have given wonderful performances in other films, each of them falls flat in this one, which is to be expected, given how little they had to work with by way of plot and direction. Seek out their other works, and avoid &quot;The Glass House&quot; like the plague.

review/summary: It's an ok thriller
review/text: Ruby and Rhett go to live with friends of the family after their parents die in a car crash. Note that I said crash instead of accident. After a strange string of events. Ruby discovers that the car "accident" may have been orchestrated. After she catches on her new parents pull the reigns in. The siblings lives may also be in danger. They have to decide between playing along or to break free.This movie is a remake so you can definitely say it has all been done before. Even so this movie is fairly entertaining. It isn't great though. The acting and the story are kinda so so. The saving grace of this movie is the suspense. This movie has some good suspense and the tension gets pretty high. If you add all the movies good and bad qualities together I think it ends up being just average. It's not a must see, but if you're bored and don't have anything else to do watching Glass House is better than sitting around and twiddling your thumbs.

review/summary: A fun and suspenseful thrill ride!!!!
review/text: ****1/2 starsOne of the best teen thrillers I have seen in the past few years, &quot;The Glass House&quot; actually delivers. We already know who the bad guys are, and that's a plus. The suspense comes with not knowing what they will do next. No one is safe...The film starts off well with an image of breaking glass, the film title, and the glass shattering into pieces...well done...but I started to roll my eyes and muttered &quot;Why?&quot; when the film opened to a screaming teen girl running away from a masked killer wielding a sharp kitchen knife, one as big as Micheal Myers used to carry around...This just didn't seem like that kind of movie...As I sat watching, I said &quot;Not again&quot; when it was revealed to be a movie within a movie in the first few seconds, but I was fascinated nontheless as we shifted from the dark movie theater where Ruby Baker sits to the image on the screen of the frightened girl fleeing her attacker...so begins this dark and suspenseful tale of murder and revenge...I enjoyed every minute of it...from the overdone opening scene to the climactic car chase at the end, this film kept me on the edge of my seat...there were some things I didnt like...for example, most of the scenes with the teenage girls didn't go along with the rest of the movie...the story is so dark, the atmosphere so claustrophobic and creepy, then you have these colorful teeny bopper girls showing up for a few seconds, and for no apparent reason...that's the only thing about the movie I didn't like...otherwise, it was an edge of the seat suspenseful and shocking picture....the whole audience, which wasn't much, was really into it...and this is one of those rare film's where I actually cared for the characters and hated the villians...I'm not going to give anything away, but I was impressed by how much I felt for the characters...a sign of a true artist...this was a great film and i definitely recommend it...I for one loved it...

review/summary: So botched.
review/text: The Glass House (Daniel Sackheim, 2001)There's a scene about two thirds of the way through The Glass House that pretty much sums up every way in which this movie went wrong. It's hard to set the scene without spoilers, but I'll attempt to do it anyway: a character has died. We know from various things, mostly a makeup job that would look appropriate in a microbudget horror film rather than a big Hollywood release, that said character has been dead for some time. Said character is found by another character. And, you know, just as character B finds character A-- who was previously quite banged around postmortem-- something character A was clutching in his/her hand is released and falls to the floor.Little stupid things like that can ruin a whole movie for me, because they tell me that the director is willing to go for the cheap shot rather than trying to keep some semblance of reality in the film. That's exactly what happens here (you see the ending coming a while before the characters do, to be sure), and it's a shame, because it turns what might have been a fun, serviceable little thriller into a waste of some incredible talent.Ruby (Joan of Arc's Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio's Trevor Morgan) have recently been orphaned. The estate's executor, Begleiter (the mighty Bruce Dern) has decided to allow the petition of family friends Terry (Insomnia's Stellan Skarsgard) and Erin (Unfaithful's Diane Lane) Glass to take the kids in, over the objections of their Uncle Jack (Law and Order's Chris Noth). All seems to be going well, but Ruby gets a weird vibe from Terry on a pretty regular basis, and begins to think that there might be some ulterior motive to the Glass' offer to take them in.This is a great cast. A great cast. Skarsgard and Lane have been among the highlights of the acting world for a lot of years between them, and Sobieski is a fast-rising star (or would be, if she'd keep her participation in such dogs as Eyes Wide Shut to a minimum). And, of course, there's Bruce Dern, whose very name inspires some film critics to cower in their respective corners, gibbering. So how did Sackheim, a very capable TV director who's worked on some of the best series on television (House, The X-Files, Millennium, Law and Order, et al.), and screenwriter Wesley Strick (True Believer, the 1991 adaptation of Cape Fear, et al.) manage to bungle this as badly as they did?I tend to lay the blame on Sackheim. Tricks like the hand thing in the first paragraph of this review play a lot better on the small screen than they do on the large screen; that's the sort of controlled cheesiness that made The X-Files so much fun to watch over the years. But then you look at Strick's fantastic track record before this movie, and you look afterwards and see Doom . What went wrong?Whichever way you look at it, though, there's wasted talent to go around here. There is some fantastic set design; one wishes as much attention to detail had been paid to letting some fine actors do their thing in front of it. **

review/summary: Shut Up and Enjoy The Movie
review/text: I'm notorious for over analyzing films. I've argued for weeks with people about the flaws of the `Star Wars' prequels and `Firefly'. `The Glass House' put me into such a good mood all I can say is, ignore the flaws and enjoy the movie.The plot: As you may remember from the trailers, this whole movie can be summed up in 30 seconds. Sister Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) and brother Rhett Baker (Trevor Morgan, lost kid in `Jurassic Park III') are orphaned by a car accident. They are sent to live with their late parents' friends, Terri and Aaron Glass who live in a big glass house. Get it? It's pretty obvious the Glasses are psycho and killed the parents to inherit their fortune, with the children in the way; it's time to kill them too. It's like one of those stalker movies we were over saturated with in the early 90s after the surprise success of `The Hand That Rocks The Cradle'.Roger Ebert described this as a movie where we already know the story; we're just waiting for the characters to catch up.Not only is the story predictable but the villains are not even scary, just pathetic. They don't commit crimes out of evil but to buy drugs and pay off loan sharks.With all that said, this is a great movie! Leelee Sobieski really looks hot in this. The filmmakers also give her some very sexy outfits for her to bounce around in. And can she bounce.Another notable performance is by uber villain Stellan Skarsgard who's always playing Eastern Europeans of different ethnicity. He was a great villain in `Ronin' as well.Director Daniel Sacheim, who mainly works on television, gives `The Glass House' and high production level, with photography and editing.Although it's only a small part of the film, this seems to be the major focus of the reviews here on Amazon-- how the Glasses force Ruby and Rhett to share the same room. Many are arguing that this serves no purpose in the plot of the film. What they fail to realize is that having teenage siblings share a room (or bed) is a classic movie technique, to experience something completely FUBAR. We can joke about it, but the truth is everyone here on Amazon seems to be morbidly curious about it. Yes, Ruby and Rhett do accuse each other of "peeking" while they undress at least 3 separate times. Hummmmm, what's in those deleted scenes? (sadly nothing)For more implied teenage sibling incest, I highly recommend, 'Flowers In the Attic.'

review/text: THE GLASS HOUSETHE MOVIE: An underrated thrill ride! I expected THE GLASS HOUSE to be a pretty silly movie as the opinions of the majority of critics were that. I'll have to be different this time and say I highly enjoyed this nicely done thriller. It has some clich&eacute;d/contrived moments and a couple of plot holes, and it could've done without the Stellan Skarsgaard-business-deal-going-wrong idea but the visuals in this movie are outstanding, with many shots suggesting something may be lurking or watching. I loved how the movie kept you in suspense the whole way through and keeps you guessing. All around a well-directed and misunderstood chiller.THE SPECIAL FEATURES: This could've been a lot better. We get great commentary from the writer and the director who help you to understand the ideas behind the shots, angles etc. There are 2 trailers, one for this film and one for URBAN LEGEND. We also get cast and crew filmographies and one deleted scene. There could've been heaps more deleted scenes because during the movie the director says things like &quot;this scene was actually after a scene we deleted&quot; and there is heaps of unused footage that you see in the trailer. That really ticked me off. What's up with just giving us ONE? Grr.

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: Normally I like movies that star Leelee Sobieski, but the Glass House was disappointing. It was a very slow moving movie. The previews made the movie look very suspenceful, but when I watched the movie, I found myself waiting for the suspenceful parts that never happened. I would not recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to choose from.

review/summary: Suspenseful, but....
review/text: there was more they could have done with it. This had the makings of a decent horror/suspense flick but it suffered from an underdeveloped plot. The basic storyline was good, but they took too much time explaining some things and not enough on other more important details.Two children are left orphaned and their new &quot;parents&quot; aren't what they seem to be. As the movie unfolds, some parts play out pretty predictably, while others come as a complete surprise. It is the latter that make this movie as good as it is. The acting is pretty average, but all in all you could do worse than spending a couple of hours on this. Fairly entertaining.

review/summary: Predictable, yet fun...
review/text: Horror movies can be categorized into two camps: original and formulatic/predictable. The former are groundbreaking, such as "Psycho" or the 1st "Nightmare on Elm St." The latter can best be illustrated by films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer.""The Glass House" falls into the latter category. But you know what's funny? After viewing a film that is formulatic/predictable, many movie goers swear up and down that they will never watch such a "stupid and predictable" movie again. But...we keep coming back for more of the same.Yes, "The Glass House" is predictable. Yes, it becomes almost a parody of what its early scenes tried to be. However, there were some tense moments created by the director, and some creepy acting by Stellan Skarsgrd and Diane Lane.My wife and I had fun watching it because of the infrequent tense moments and the stereotypical script. However, I wish that amazon.com would incorporate 1/2 star ratings, because this movie was more of a 2 1/2 star flick than a 3 star flick.

review/summary: Superb Dramatic Thriller
review/text: The movie is a wonderful thriller, not a dim witted slasher movie. Thus the movie is well worth watching. The story proceeds nicely with intelligible dangers. It is obvious that the producers avoided dumb slasher contrivances. The movie set ups are very good. And the acting is excellent. In particular the cast was led by Leelee Sobieski, one of the most beautiful and consistently talented actresses on the scene today. I think the negative reviews come from individuals who have become jaded and insensitive to beauty and taste.

review/text: As much as I loved the film, I have to give this particular release one star because it suffers from RCE (the pathetic pseudoprotection supposed to prevent its playback outside R1 areas); to watch it, I had to switch my player's region from 0 to 1, which takes 6 key presses on my remote and is therefore time-consuming... all right, so it was not a real problem, but since RCE DVDs are universally boycotted, I feel this warning is in order.

review/text: Money is the root of all evil in this movie -- and lots of evil there is! Two children are orphaned and old neighbors become their guardians. The guardians are really after the children's inheritence to get out of a frighteningly bad debt. The plot takes some twists and turns and comes to a thrilling conclusion that made my palms sweat. I didn't give this 5 stars though since I probably wouldn't be interested in watching this movie more than once -- it was no classic. Leelee Sobieski, young Ruby, steels the show. If she wasn't in this movie, it would qualify only as a B movie at best. Still, entertaining enough to watch, but rent it, don't buy it.

review/summary: Sobieski Saves the Day (and the Film)
review/text: That there is nothing new under the sun is aptly demonstrated by this suspense/thriller which, though not too original, has some good moments and boasts a terrific performance by Leelee Sobieski. All of which makes &#8220;The Glass House,&#8221; directed by Daniel Sackheim, worth a look. It&#8217;s a road you&#8217;ve no doubt been down before, and pretty early on you have a good idea of where it&#8217;s going to wind up; but it&#8217;s well crafted and delivered, and serves as a showcase for Sobieski, who is one of the finest young actors in the business today.When their parents are killed in a car wreck, sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker (Sobieski) and her eleven-year-old brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), find themselves under the guardianship of Terrence and Dr. Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), who are apparently well off financially, and have a rather nice house that sits on a cliff in Malibu, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It&#8217;s seemingly an idyll setting, but from the moment the children move in the climate within the household seems uncomfortable to all but Rhett. Ruby senses something disconcerting with the arrangement, but there&#8217;s not much she can do about it. The executor of the Baker&#8217;s will, Alvin Begleiter (Bruce Dern), advises Ruby that if it doesn&#8217;t work out with Mr. and Mrs. Glass, she and Rhett would become wards of the court; not a happy prospect. It quickly becomes apparent to Ruby, however, that there&#8217;s more than meets the eye at play here, but to whom can she turn? And therein lies the conundrum, because the answer is a resounding &#8220;no one.&#8221; And especially in the wake of her parent&#8217;s death, that&#8217;s a tough thing for a sixteen-year-old to have to face. What she doesn&#8217;t know, as well, is that it&#8217;s going to get a lot worse before it gets better.Director Sackheim does a good job of keeping up the tension in his film, but it could have been more effective had he employed a bit more subtlety and nuance. And he has a troublesome affinity for camera shots through doors that are open just a crack, which allows one character (as well as the audience) to get a glimpse of another, as well as whatever is going on in the next room. Initially, it works; but by the end of the film the impact it affords is diluted by overkill. Things can only go bump in the night so many times, and you can only hold your breath so many times waiting for the eavesdropper to be discovered before it becomes second nature and ceases to be effective. Even so, these are elements that can be overlooked, however, as Sackheim does keep it all moving along at a pace that sustains interest. But the unimaginative ending is something of a letdown, and just too pat to ultimately have much of an impact.The saving grace of the film is clearly Sobieski, who as she matures is emerging as a cross between Helen Hunt and Jodie Foster, but with a talent and style uniquely her own. In Ruby, she delivers a well rounded, three dimensional character which, in lesser hands, could easily have fallen into stereotype. Ruby, however, is anything but. This is a girl who comes from privilege (money, private school), and like any normal teenager has a certain disdain for her parents. She knows her way around and is not beneath sneaking out into uncharted territory occasionally. Sobieski makes her extremely believable, especially in her reactions to all that happens to and around her. The scene in which she learns of her parent&#8217;s death is played very well, very real, as are the scenes in which her suspicions become increasingly aroused. And it&#8217;s that level of realism she attains and brings to the character that carries the film.Diane Lane, on the other hand, does not fare as well. Her performance as Erin is passable, but fairly weak. She fails to bring anything to the role to make her character unique; it&#8217;s as if she never quite got a handle on who this person really is that she&#8217;s trying to portray. To be fair, she does have her moments, but overall, her work here is average, at best.In Terry, Stellan Skarsgard creates a character who is not so much sinister as down right creepy. He lacks the menace that would&#8217;ve made Ruby&#8217;s situation scarier, but in retrospect, his character is more real because of it. And he has a slimy leer that is so very telling in regards to who Terry is. Some of his actions at times seem too &#8220;staged,&#8221; like when he reaches across Ruby in the car to buckle her seat belt, but that falls on Sackheim, and is certainly not a reflection on Skarsgard&#8217;s performance, which is quite convincing.The supporting cast includes Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Michael O&#8217;Keefe (David Baker), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Chris Noth (Uncle Jack), Rachel Wilson (Hannah), Michael Paul Chan (Mr. Kim) and Carly Pope (Tasha). Though not the greatest movie ever made, this one still has something to offer by way of atmosphere, some suspense, a few thrills and a decent (if not highly original) story. But the main thing &#8220;The Glass House&#8221; has to offer is the memorable performance by Leelee Sobieski, who takes this film to a higher level single-handedly. In the final analysis, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward storytelling, and it is entertaining; for a thriller, you could do much worse. And that&#8217;s the magic of the movies.

review/summary: For Those Adore Lovely Leelee and Entertaining B-Movies
review/text: I'm a fan of Leelee Sobieski, and to me the greatest merit of watching "Deep Impact" was not a big meteo or some flashy CGI images, but just her presence. For exactly the same reason, I watched this thriller, which turned out slightly better than what I expected.Just like her previous work "Joy Ride," "The Glass House" works as unpretencious B-movie. And this is not a back-handed compliment, for it generates some considerable suspence for all its ridiculous plot, which sets up its premise quickly with a orphaned Leelee's character and her younger brother, who are to be adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Glass. At first, the new life seems fine, but soon Mr. Glass starts to show his true colors.Most recommendable thing about the film is Leelee Sobieski's acting, which easily creates a likable, credible central character you can relate to. And she even goes in for her sexy side, at one scene appearing in swimming suit (before she knew that someone is watching over her), just in case you're interested. About other actors, I do not have much to say, except that the villains are played exactly like villains, and Bruce Dern, as everybody expects, plays his part of lawyer with a suspicious shade. And, like me, for those who remember Diane Lane when she was a child actor, it is painful to watch some of the scenes her character is included.The shaky script has so many holes that you can pick up several points and say "Why don't you do this or that?" and it goes on and on, finally involves a crash scene with a high-speed cars on a mountain road, but owing to first-time feature director Daniel Sackheim (previously working for many TV series like "X-Files" "ER" and others), we anyway forget these things ... temporarily. After all, this is a kind of entertainment that you saw in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and such thrillers, and while many ridicule them on the ground of implausible situation, others love them just on the same ground. Enjoy it.

review/summary: TRANSPARENT STONE THROWING
review/text: My three-star rating is, I think, a tad generous, but it seemed more fair than two, because this movie does have some real suspense. It seems that every young actress that starts out innocent these days must soon get corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski so lovably sweet and innocent in DEEP IMPACT? Then her innocence acquired a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Still good and likeable. But after that came the seemingly obligatory squandering of innocence. For Leelee that lurid rite of passage was exceptioally harsh and gratuitous, in a bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then her characters seem to have an inexorable element of sniveling brat, too potent to be completely eclipsed by heavy plot elements making her a put-upon character, whether playing a terminally ill girl in HERE ON EARTH or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the name of it's residents. Mr. Glass is played by Stellan Skarsgrd, who, if not in danger of becoming typecast already, certainly is after this movie. He's a relative of Leelee's character, Ruby, and becoms her guardian after her parents die in a car crash. At first at least, Mr Glass seems a put-upon character. Early on we see him being beaten up by obviously unsavory characters, loan sharks as it turns out. How then do we want to see the movie develop from this point? Well, for me, not exactly as it in fact does develop. There may be overkill in some characterizations. And what looks like the developing plot tensions may end up so eclipsed and overwhelmed as to be forgotten. That's not exactly what I wanted. A little bit more of things being what they seemed in the right places would have made it more to my liking. But if your tastes are somewhat different and those objections matter little or none to you, you might find this a quite satisfying thriller as it builds up to a taut climax.

review/summary: It's nothing spectacular, but it works...
review/text: Typical and predictable, this is one of those films that is surely entertaining and an unintentionally campy kind of way. The film, while starting off rather strong, dissolves into ridiculousness, but for some strange reason it never really loses what it initially set out to attain; our attention.When their parents die in a freak car accident, Ruby and her younger brother find themselves in a gigantic (albeit creepy) house with their new guardians. While they are on the outset charming and generous, Ruby's new family soon becomes anything but. As the film progresses, Ruby begins to uncover dark secrets and suspicious about her parent's death and the true intentions of her new `daddy'.This film came out right about the time that Leelee Sobieski was becoming famous; you know, that two-year period when she was in movies. I'm saddened that her career didn't go anywhere. She had talent. She had looks. She had appeal. I can't explain her disappearance, for it doesn't really make sense (but then again, there are a number of starlets who all but disappeared for no reason). As a vehicle to show off her rise to fame, this one works well. She definitely works the camera and knows how to address the melancholy side of the story without overdoing it.For me though, this film rests on Stellan Skarsgard's performance.Without a keen eye and an understanding delivery, this performance could have tanked this entire film. Instead, Stellan breathes a life into his character that is every ounce of what it should be. Yes, in the end he kind of veers off into absurdity along with the script (why did they do that) but he maintains a level of honest eeriness that keeps his character chilling, not comical.This is far from a great movie, but it is far from a waste of time. It's eerie and entertaining and engrossing, and sometimes that is all you need.

review/summary: Good performances, astoundingly bad script
review/text: Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable "thriller" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot "twist" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else.And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless.If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent. But she is certainly nice to watch, especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious, delicious, nutritious, I-want-some-of-that-icious body. But hey, when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal, right?Rent this one first if you absolutely must see it.

The Glasse's house and the Glasses themselves seem great at first glance, but suddenly strange occurences begin to happen and Ruby begins to uncover the horrible truth behind the Glasses and the deaths of her parents. The truth lies deep in the glass house.This is a first rate thriller, I must say. It is jam packed with suspence and interesting twists that glue your eyeballs to the screen. All the actors give great performances, especially the young and lovely LeeLee Sobieski as the troubled Ruby. The film does not rely on the gore and blood but more on the situation istelf and the jolting suspence which is a nice change from alot the thrillers now a days. So just sit back and get ready to walk in &quot;The Glass House&quot;!Overall: A first rate thriller that fully relies on the suspence and not the gore!Grade: A+

review/text: When there parents die in a tragic accident,A teen and her kid brother go to stay with there wealthy family friends,the Glasses in Malibu.But little do the sibling know,the Glasses are hiding a very sinister secret.When I first heard of this movie I thought it would be a decent thriller,with an interesting premise that looked promising enough.But unfortunately I was wrong.It lacked the thrills I was looking for with a very disappointing plot twist that i am not going to give away.Leeleee Sobieski made a very boring and overall uninteresting and pretty bland heroine but at least Stellan Skarsgard made a somewhat decent villain.Overall this film was just a disappointing thriller all around.

review/summary: A &quot;Shattering&quot; Thriller
review/text: In THE GLASS HOUSE, murder runs rampant amid the scenic backdrop of Malibu. An accidental dealth leaves two children, Ruby played by Leelee Sobieski and Rhett played by Trevor Morgan, orphans. They are placed into the custody of their neighbors, Trevor and Erin Glass.Their home has half of its structure made out of glass, a beautiful site, but one where the cold atmosphere clearly shows that life is about to change. Everything the kids do is monitored as no aspect of their lives is private. Somehow, Trevor and Erin seem to be everywhere imaginable, yet seemingly never around. Things really heat up once Ruby finds out about the skeletons in her new guardians' closet.Although the plotline is fairly predictable, the acting is quite good, and the suspense will give you goosebumps. Leelee Sobieski is wonderful in her role, and Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgaard play excellent adversaries. GLASS HOUSE also features cameos by Chris Noth and Rita Wilson, completing the cast quite nicely.Overall, this is a fairly entertaining film that will definately make you flinch in your seat a couple of times. It won't dissappoint.

review/summary: Beware of flying cliche projectiles
review/text: Saying a movie has too many cliches is a cliche in itself, but man, somebody arrived to the set of this movie in an oil tanker filled with cliches and spilled it all over the place. Cliches were flying out of my tv screen like sharp knives putting everyone in my family in danger. My cat found a cliche in her food dish and tried to eat it.But then again, The Glass House was fun to watch in some ways. One being that I was able to predict exactly what was going to happen next every 2.3 minutes. We had the typical "try to quietly steal the bad guy's car keys when he's sleeping then make a little noise and the bad guy tosses and turns a bit but doesnt wake up then you finally get the car keys but he eventually wakes up anyway to chase you" scene. You know that scene? Well it happened two seperate times in this movie! Neither scene was suspenseful, and I'm suprised anyone else felt this movie was suspenseful at all when you can predict what's going to happen next in every scene.LeeLee Sobieski shows potential as an actress, and wasn't too bad here considering the material, but she seemed very bored with the part. If got to a point where ya just want to enter the movie yourself and explain to her how to call the police, or take your clueless Nintendo playing brother and run as far away from this glass house as possible. But then the movie only would've lasted 15 minutes right?Good. I know I'm not supposed to say anything bad about the other reviewers, but I just can't understand how anyone would think this movie was good, suspensful, or scary in the least. What the heck is wrong with you people.2 stars because the movie looked nice.

review/summary: Transparent Stone Throwing
review/text: My three-star rating is perhaps a bit generous, but I thought it was fairer than two stars, because this movie does deliver some real suspense. Every time a young actress today starts out delightfully innocent, it seems she has to be soon corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski wonderfully sweet and lovable in DEEP IMPACT? Her innocence survived and still shone, albeit with a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Then with Leelee the seemingly obligatory squandering came with exceptional harshenss and gratuitousness. In a seemingly pointless bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie, she suffered that perverse rite of passage in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then, her characters seem stuck with a definite element of sniveling brat, never wholly rendered palatable even by heavy put-upon plot elements, such as playing a terminally ill character in HERE ON EARTH, or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the surname of its occupants. Mr. and Mrs. Glass are the Godparents of Ruby, Leelee's character. They become her guardians after her parents die in a car crash. Mr Glass is played by Soren Starsgaard, who, if not already in danger of becoming typecast, certainly is after this movie. What are we to make of him? Early on we see him being beaten up by some obviously unsavory characters (loan sharks as it turns out). How if at all does this begin to reveal the plot's central tension? Not in a way completely palatable to me. There may end up being overkill in some plot elements. And the finally evolving central tensions may complete eclipse and overwhelm what looked at first central, so that the earlier tension is forgotten. I wanted a bit more of things being what they seemed at the right places, with no plot twist so overwhelming as to demand that I forget a former one. But if your tastes are different and those objections matter little or none to you, then you might find this a quite satisfying thriller building up to a taut climax.

review/summary: DIANE LANE and LEELEE SOBIESKI deliver in great thriller
review/text: This is a very effective and entertaining thriller. The 2 hours just fly by and there are several 'jump' scenes and I and many others were glued to their seats throughout. The cast is very, very good for this kind of film. DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd) is very effective as the villainess, and STELLAN SKARSGAARD (who I'm not familiar with) was also very creepy. LEELEE SOBIESKI (Deep Impact, Eyes Wide Shut) also shines as the heroine. The film also has a great soundtrack and a 'blue filtered' eerie appearence. Highly recommended for those who like good entertainment and good suspense. Check it out!

review/text: My three-star rating is, I think, a tad generous, but it seemed more fair than two, because this movie does have some real suspense. It seems that every young actress that starts out innocent these days must soon get corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski so lovably sweet and innocent in DEEP IMPACT? Then her innocence acquired a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Still good and likeable. But after that came the seemingly obligatory squandering of innocence. For Leelee that lurid rite of passage was exceptioally harsh and gratuitous, in a bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then her characters seem to have an inexorable element of sniveling brat, too potent to be completely eclipsed by heavy plot elements making her a put-upon character, whether playing a terminally ill girl in HERE ON EARTH or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the name of it's residents. Mr. Glass is played by Soren Starsgaard, who, if not in danger of becoming typecast already, certainly is after this movie. He's a relative of Leelee's character and becoms her guardian after her parents die in a car crash. At first at least, Mr Glass seems a put-upon character. Early on we see him being beaten up by obviously unsavory characters, loan sharks as it turns out. How then do we want to see the movie develop from this point? Well, for me, not exactly as it in fact does develop. There may be overkill in some characterizations. And what looks like the developing plot tensions may end up so eclipsed and overwhelmed as to be forgotten. That's not exactly what I wanted. A little bit more of things being what they seemed in the right places would have made it more to my liking. But if your tastes are somewhat different and those objections matter little or none to you, you might find this a quite satisfying thriller as it builds up to a taut climax.

review/summary: An absorbing, intense psychological thriller
review/text: After an impressive number of supporting movie roles, the lovely Leelee Sobieski takes center stage in this impressive psychological thriller, delivering a performance I found both wonderful and, most importantly, believable. While the plot may not be all that original and unpredictable, I found The Glass House to be an absorbing, suspenseful movie that never relented in its building psychological intensity. Anyone who sets out to hurt a character played by Leelee gets my full attention and disdain, but the evil husband and wife responsible for all the villainy espoused in this film do an excellent job of deserving all the disgust I felt for them.While Miss Sobieski looks a tad older than the sweet sixteen age of her character Ruby Baker, her natural sweetness and vulnerability make her quite convincing as a normal young teenager whose life is thrown into chaos when her parents are killed in an automobile accident. Ruby and her eleven-year-old brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) go to live with Terry and Erin Glass (played quite impressively by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), their former neighbors and designated custodians. Their new home is an impressive, unique structure with many glass walls and an ultra-modern interior design. Rhett settles in quite well, but Ruby is uncomfortable from the start. Early on, she realizes that the Glasses are not the perfect couple they purport to be. At first, she attempts to rationalize her problems, ascribing her difficulty adjusting to her new life as a natural reaction to her grief over the loss of her parents and the social dislocation she feels upon moving to a new city and attending a new school. Little things continue to happen, however, and she soon finds herself seeking help from her parents' estate lawyer. When she learns that her parents' estate adds up to four million dollars, she finally begins to suspect her guardians of having somehow played a part in her parents' deaths and to fear that she and her brother are in grave danger as long as they remain in the house.I thought the ending played out very well. There was one important plot point which I did not expect (along with a few that I did), and the suspense that had been building up consistently throughout the movie reached its peak at just the right time. I don't find any real absurdity to the ending - slightly clich&eacute;d: yes, but absurd: no. I think Sobieski is just wonderful and quite convincing in her role of what is a pretty typical teenaged girl forced to deal with a terrifying, almost hopeless situation. The film succeeds as well as it does, in my opinion, because Lane and Skarsgard give strong performances of their own opposite Sobieski's. The end result is a suspenseful triumph that I found refreshingly thrilling and convincing.

review/summary: You can see right through it.
review/text: This is the kind of movie I'd expect to see on HBO some night starring Elizabeth Berkley and Lance Henrikson, not coming to a theatre near me with Leelee Sobieski and Stellen Skaarsgard. Okay, I'd trade Stellen for Lance everyday of the week and twice on Sunday, but you get the idea.Ruby (Sobieski) is a fun-loving normal teen until her parents' untimely demise in a car accident. Along with her brother, she is sent to live with the Glasses...Glass's...Glassesses. Whatever. You can probably guess if you've seen these kinds of movies that they appear normal at first but after a while Mrs. Glass (Diane Lane) starts to look like an obsessive flake and Mr. Glass (Skaarsgard) starts to look like a leering, horny, letch. Of course, no one will believe Ruby when she tells them. You probably could guess that. The whole thing reaches its conclusion in a ludicrous car battle between Leelee and Stellan (in full Jason-you-can't-kill-him mode) and some guys that Stellan owes money to thrown in for fodder.Let's do a post-mortem. There's nothing really wrong with The Glass House (not in a Freddie Got Fingered way). It's just kinda blah. The only reason I feel an ounce of sympathy for Ruby is because she's played by Sobieski who could bring warmth to a Hillary Clinton biography. Sorry, Hill. Stellan is good, but not as good as in Insomnia. And why put Diane Lane in this movie and give her so little to do. Jennifer Rubin could have played the exact same role just as effectively (and probably a lot cheaper).The place where this movie really excels and separates itself from the made-for-cable stuff you see on HBO is the cinematography. The whole movie just looks amazing. The Glass's house, while luxurious, is cold and forbidding (just like the Glasses). It almost feels like they said "Hey, we have this house that looks really cool, come up with a movie for it." If you have HDTV with a 16:9 screen I could almost recommend this movie just to show it off. Almost.Try to catch it on cable instead.

review/summary: PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES...
review/text: This is an enjoyable, though predictable, thriller that seems more like a made for television movie rather than a motion picture made as a feature film release for the big screen. This is not entirely surprising, as it is directed by Daniel Sackman, a veteran television director.The plot is fairly straightforward. Sixteen year old Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobielski) and her brother, eleven year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan)), are living the lives of normal, carefree kids with their loving parents, Grace (Rita Wilson) and David Baker (Michael O'Keefe). The world, as they know it, comes crashing down on them when their parents unexpectedly die in what appears to be a routine car accident. The family lawyer, Alvin Bergletter (Bruce Dern), informs the children that the terms of their parents' have left them wealthy and in the care and custody of former neighbors, Erin (Diane Lane) and Terry Glass (Stellan Skarsgard).Before you know it, Ruby and Trevor are esconced in the Glass Malibu home, a huge, luxurious, all glass structure. Immediately, the viewer senses something is wrong, as, amidst all this room and spaciousness, Ruby and Trevor are forced to share a bedroom. A series of unsettling events serve to make Ruby suspicious of the motives of Erin and Terry Glass and cause her to make unwelcome inquiries into the deaths of her parents. What she discovers, however, comes as no surprise to the discerning viewer, who should have little difficulty in figuring out what is going on.The performances, by and large, are adequate. Leelee Sobielski is somewhat wooden in her portrayal of Ruby, mistaking a deadpan expression for seriousness of purpose. Trevor Morgan is merely annoying, but this is brought about by a script that requires him to utter the word, "Sweet", everytime he is pleased with something. Their characterization of the children makes it difficult for the viewer to warm up to either of them.Diane Lane sleepwalks through her part, which may be fitting considering her specific personal problem in the film. Stellan Skarsgard is appropriately menacing in a very controlled way. His is one of the better performances. The only odd note is that an accent of sorts seems to occassionally slip out, which is somewhat jarring. Bruce Dern is excellent as the family attorney, as is Chris Noth in the small role of the children's estranged uncle.The DVD provides a very clear, high quality picture and sound. Other than the usual commentary and filmmaker interviews, the DVD does not offer all that much. For those who enjoy the inclusion of deleted scenes, this DVD offers exactly one such scene.

review/summary: A thriller that doesn't quite &quot;thrill.&quot;
review/text: I love the actors in this movie! Hands down, you couldn't have picked a better cast. The &quot;glass house&quot; used in the film adds a lot of interesting mood throughout the film but what about all the rain? Does it really rain that much in Malibu? It seemed like it only rains at night strangely enough and then it's bright and sunny the next day like it never rained the night before? Hmmm. I guess I am nitpicking on this one but it simply doesn't hold one genuine candle of suspense throughout the whole film! To start off, Leelee does not even look remotely 16 years old, (she's actually 23), Diane Lane (I can't believe how she has literally never aged!) is a brilliant actress but she's left scraping for crumbs here since her talent is far wasted against Stellan's character. Unfortunately, this movie plays like an afterschool special that ABC decided to air at night-LOL. It's got the dark atmosphere, the creepy incestial sensibilities, the weird familial episodes of drug use and the odd brother sleeping with sister thing, but it just doesn't tie together well. Too many plot holes, too many scenes that don't gel together properly and not enough &quot;realism&quot; to keep the audience interested. Wait for video on this one folks!

review/summary: Broken Script = Broken 'Glass'
review/text: The problem with titling a movie The Glass House is that it tempts critics and viewers to throw verbal stones at it. I will try to avoid that temptation, as the movie already has plenty of cracks in it.Strong thrillers are generally those in which the events are fairly plausible -- or at least they are believable enough for you not to question them until after the movie is over. A decent one is one in which the plot is silly but so much fun you put up with it. A mediocre thriller, such as The Glass House, is marred by plot holes so big that they bug you. You can't stop thinking about them. You begin to see the characters' actions as simply responses to the script's absurd demands. The actors start looking like people just working for a paycheck.Sixteen year old Ruby [Leelee Sobieski] and her brother, Rhett [Trevor Morgan], who is twelve, are orphaned when their parents are killed in an auto accident. Their parents' will leaves the kids well provided for, but their choice of guardians is not good. They picked Terry and Erin Glass [Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane], supposedly their best friends. The couple moves Ruby and Rhett into their vast, ultramodern house in California's chic Malibu. The house is all glass, stainless steel, and cold blues, never a good sign for movie orphans. The first weird thing the Glasses do is to house the children together in the same room. Ruby immediately picks up on the strange vibes, while Rhett remains clueless throughout the movie, apparently having suffered permanent brain damage from too much Nintendo. Terry puts the moves on Ruby, while Erin, a pain management doctor, spends her time off shooting up drugs. Could they be after the kid's inheritance? Ruby tries to get help, but nobody believes her. They don't believe her either because the script tells them not to or because she frowns and mumbles all the time.That part about having the same bedroom, which occurs early in the movie, was the first plot hole that threw me. The reason the Glasses do this is never addressed. It's not like there aren't a dozen bedrooms in the place. If the couple is plotting to do away with the kids, wouldn't having everything appear to be normal make sense? Why start off by alarming them? When Ruby goes to the family attorney, he points out that, if they are taken away from the Glasses, they will be made wards of the state. Why? Ruby and the audience find out at the start that she has an uncle in Chicago. Sure, until the funeral, he hasn't been to visit in ten years, but it's obvious he's a nice, caring guy. Best or worst of all is why the parents would entrust their children with the Glasses in the first place. They're obviously fruitcakes, good friends or not.Sobieski, a young Helen Hunt look-a-like, is a fine actress, but she is lost in this material. The pain on her face looks as if it came from long fights with the director over her character's motivation. As the Glasses, Lane and Skarsgaard are great in their quieter moments but are laughable in the scenes where they must be over the top. Bruce Dern has a nice cameo as a sinister lawyer, as does Kathy Bates as a social worker.The photography is first-rate and is the movie's strongest asset. The music is properly chilling. The plot's basic elements have successfully worked in other thrillers. It's too bad the writers' didn't think to watch them first.

review/summary: Fair Thriller with Believable Acting
review/text: The Glass House has been getting mixed reviews. And that's just how the audience is. They're mixed. You can either love this movie, or hate this movie. I 'like' this movie. I found it to be an entertaining thriller with believable acting and likable or not likable characters.When Ruby (LeeLee Sobeiski) and Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents are in an accident, they are sent to live with the Glasses, people who used to be their next door neighbors. There's way more plot than that in the movie, but I don't want to ruin anything. There's not much to ruin, but I went into the movie thinking that Mr. Glass (Stellan Skarsgard) was just some crazy lunatic that made his wife (Diane Lane) go crazy too, and they were just out for the kids. Nope, it has more depth than that. I didn't even expect that. There was some suspense at times. Most at the end, but as Ruby goes about figuring out the insanity behind the Glasses in the middle, there are some tense moments. I've got to mention the colors that were used in the film. Or most notably, the colors used at night time in the &quot;glass house.&quot; Shimmers of shades of blue and black flicker on the wall because of the water from the pool outside, but it set the mood for some scenes.The acting was pretty believable. LeeLee Sobeiski, who reminds me a LOT of Helen Hunt, is a young . . . Helen Hunt. She was awesome. Trevor Morgan, who was last and I guess first seen in Jurassic Park 3, played the little brother perfect. The kid can act. Stellan Skargard was at times, a little too into his character it seemed, and it made him a little bit creepy. He perfected the &quot;quick turn around, I see you&quot; thing. Diane Lane's character should have been fleshed out a little bit more, but she did well with what she did.I enjoyed The Glass House, but some may think of it as another &quot;Crazy step-parent thriller.&quot; That's just how it goes though.

The 16 year old at the center is suspicious from the start, but most of the film is a build up to her worst fears coming true. The script is mediocre, so the tension isn't there and the evil guardians don't ring true either.

review/text: I thought this film would be like Hand That Rocks The Cradle. Obviously it was just a reason to give LeeLee a starring role. The best actors are the insane couple. LeeLee is stiff and under acts the entire film. The director gets an A for effort, but this film is nothing different. The Glass House is all right for a movie to catch on late-night cable. But I wouldn't spend any money on it. I bought the movie when it first came out on video and have sense tossed it in the trash. Not exciting enough to keep watching. Save your time and energy for Joy Ride if you're a LeeLee Sobieski fan.

review/text: Okay, I admit, I was totally psyched to see this film because it looked like a slick scary thriller. I came out of the theater dissapointed. Totally not scary in anyway. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this very much but it just wasn't what I thought it would be.

review/summary: Much better than I thought it would be!!!
review/text: I got this movie out with not a huge interest but just to see something on a Saterday night. I was really blow away of how GOOD this movie turned out . It was very suspenceful and scary. The climax was really good. It stars Leelee Sobieski ( Never Been Kissed, Deep Impact ) who I was never really keen on, untill I saw this and now I think shes a good actor.One of my favourite characters in this was the Boy played by Trevor Morgan ( Jurassic Park 3, The Patriot ) because it was cool to relate to someone my age. Over all this movie was very good and I'm defintly going to buy it on DVD.

review/summary: Just an average movie.
review/text: Like so many other movies, this one is about money-- the obsession some people have of it and how that obsession is harmful to them and others. These kids' parents both just died on the way home from celebrating their anniversary. Supposedly, the driver had too much booze in him and swerved off the road in the rain. So the kids go and live with Mr. and Mrs. Glass who live in a glass house. They were old friends of the parents and were to be the legal guardians of their kids if something like this were to happen. Their lawyer tells the kids that their parents were economical and they left them several million dollars. It turns out the Glasses were using them to try to steal their money.Mrs. Glass is a doctor but she turns out to be addicted to heroin. Mr. Glass is in business but their money for the Glass House and his Jaguar sports car turned out to come from a loan shark. It's mysterious at first, because the girl isn't sure whether or not the Glasses are sincere or what the hell is going on. Her brother is younger and is simply content and bought-off with everything the Glasses spoil him with. She does some research and finds out that her parents were set up and murdered; it was no accident. The girl is pretty [good looking], especially when she's in the swimming pool in the scene where Mr. Glass comes out with a towel in the middle of the night.The point of the movie is that money has good use, but you've gotta earn it and be productive-- stealing it doesn't work. And you've gotta live within your means and stay out of debt. Mr. Glass never seemed very happy even with all the "toys". It sure didn't seem like it was worth all the stress and trouble that he went through to try to steal their money.

review/text: How bad this movie is.It's not just cheesy, it's also dumb. Just plain dumb. What happens when you get an intriguing plot, good actors, and cool sets? Oddly enough, you get a poorly acted, scripted, ridiculous film.The plot is pretty good, although not in the least bit scary, as was advertised in the trailers. During the dramatic parts, I couldn't keep from laughing. It was hard to believe some people actually wanted us to be quiet - were they actually enjoying the film? The acting done by the man who plays Terry Glass is comical, not a reflection on him though - just the silly character. They try to keep you guessing, but I knew what was going on the moment I sat down (and I arrived late!)Bottom line: Don't waste your money, like I did. At least see something midly enteraining, like 'The Musketeer', if you insist on seeing a bad movie this fall.

review/summary: Sullen teen trapped with evil guardians
review/text: Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and her 11 year old brother and sent to to live with The Glass family after their parents die in a car accident. Things get creepy right away, as Mr. and Mrs. Glass's veneer of friendliness begins to fade away and their true colors appear. Mr. Glass seems to have more than fatherly intentions towards Ruby and Mrs. Glass is a drug addict (although she says she is a diabetic...uh-huh, sure..) They are far from the compassionate caretakers they pretend to be and their motive is greed- pure and simple. The children have inherited a fortune and the Glasses need money. Badly.Unfortunately, the promising setup falls flat. Leelee Sobieski, a capable actress in other movies, is sorely miscast in this one. Her continually sullen dimeanor makes it hard to warm up to her. In fact, no one in this movie is particularly watchable or likeable.Evem worse the plot has more holes than a sieve and isn't scarey as much as it is just plain silly. If you're into architecture, however, you will love the Glass's house. It appears to be made entirely of glass (the Glasses live in a glass house, get it?) and it is truly breathtaking. I would have enjoyed a 2 hour video tour of the house instead of the time wasted watching the movie.

review/summary: Worst Movie I've Seen this year
review/text: I've seen a lot of movies in the theater this year, but this one was by far the worst. I came expecting a thriller, but it was more like I was going to fall asleep. The trailer is totally misleading, it looks all suspenseful. It's stupid, boring and I couldn't wait to get out of it. My butt ached the whole time and I got up to get food or to the bathroom a million times, because I wasn't afraid to miss anything.

review/summary: Classy thriller with brains
review/text: After their parents are killed in a car accident, Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and her younger brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) are sent to live with their long time friends, the Glasses. While at first the Glasses seem like the ideal replacement parents, Ruby soon discovers that their intentions are somewhat more devious.As Ruby, Sobieski glows with talent and beauty. Morgan, who was in July's &quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; also does a good job. Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane are excellent as the Glasses. They are truly terrifying when the evil starts lurking about. All the talent makes for a delightfully classy thriller.

review/summary: Chasing Echoes is a Hit and a Hoot
review/text: A facinating, funny, and compelling character study. Follow the life of Davas as he stumbles through life in Brookside. Meet the people that you and he run into everyday; Mr C. Knyles (the "K" is silent), the babbling man trying to tell you the same story he has been trying to tell you for years now. He never will get to the point. Relax with a cup of herb tea, as your far out waitresses, April Showers and Mae Flowers pad softly in their earth shoes across the natural, worn wood floors. Perhaps see a bit of your self as one attending the meeting of the CRAP group - (Concerned Citizens that Abhor Pandemonium.) Dr. Randall Bowden's first work of fiction is hilarious, compelling, all over the place, yet tightly focused. He has captured a slice of everyone's life and put it on the table for examination. Life is OK... crazy, but OK.

review/summary: Merveilleux
review/text: This group from Quebec is a melange of styles, but certainly have a country and folk element as well as traditional quebecois--which is country and folk after all. The two CD set also comes with a DVD with several music videos and quite a bit of footage from the concert as well as a documentry. The latter is all in very accented Quebec French and, though I speak French, I found it hard to follow--but certainly got the gist of what they said.Their Quebec accented French is "savoreux" if a little hard to understand. One drawback is that the words are not included. There are Internet sources where most of their lyrics can be found.I love it. Toune d'automne is wonderful haunting song and is on the DVD as well as the CD. Their musicianship is terrific. Judging by the way the crowd sang along they have a real following in La Belle Province.If you like tradition mixed with contemporary and a mixture of styles, then you will enjoy Les Cowboys Fringants.

review/summary: Great Book, Fascinating story
review/text: The novel, Adorable Sunday, is about the fascinating life of a teenage girl, just like one of you, dealing with the difficulties of the exciting world of the television commercial filming.Friendship, dedication, trust and bravery are some of the topics or themes that are addressed along the pages of the novel. Some guts were also involved.Sunday, the main character, is in showbiz. Being a lovely, friendly, and a careful girl, will not help her a lot. What she needs to obtain is confidence in her self and an impacting new look.Heather is Sunday&#65533;s new friend that she met in the auditions. She is a beautiful and attractive teenage girl, maybe one year older than Sunday. As talented as she is, while doing her job, she is also very gifted at being friends with other people she meets.Both of Sunday&#65533;s loving parents work at the television station. They always have wanted that their daughter, Sunday, will someday become a famous and well-known star. Both of them are very loving and caring when it comes to their children, which they love a lot.All the characters mentioned above, and the others in the novel, are very believable by the way the author does a great job at describing them. Their actions, their thoughts, their words, their feelings and their behavior were very believable. I like the characters a lot.This novel takes place in a city full of fame creating business. Many young people try to become famous at something, but only some of them make it, only the gifted ones.Trying to get better at something, Sunday always wanted to be famous. Sunday&#65533;s parents, help her to be what she wants, a well-known and famous television star. She always tries to be good enough for the director&#65533;s eyes. Sunday goes through many hardships when taking this new job. This job implies to go out of her town and going to the filming studios in another city. She has problems at school with her teachers, grades and friends. She has the great opportunity to continue with her job or quitting if her problems get too big.This novel was very nice. I would recommend it to the all girls that are looking forward to becoming famous at something.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this...but I don't
review/text: Intro-----I bought my wife a car for her birthday this year. I live in the Las Vegas Desert and the sun really destroys a car here, as well as make the inside so HOT! -- This seemed to be the best option to truly keep the sun out.PROS----1. When you get over all the CONS, it really does work.2. It fits pretty well.CONS----1. Nothing fancy about it. My wife wanted something more stylish. Wasn't happy it at all.2. It's SO dang bulky...serious! - Even rolled up, it takes up so much room.----when all four of us are in the car, there's not much room for it. Has to be 'trunked'3. It's so HEAVY that the center sags - not all too much yet, but it does seem to be increasing with time.4. You nearly have to take the thing out of the car to roll it up (again, because it's so big and bulky)CONCLUSION----------How many different ways can I say it? It's just too bulky. I MUST mention, that bulk is what makes it so affective at reducing heat. Being that it fits the window pretty well, it works better than any other sunshade I've owned.The sad thing is that it's so inconvenient to use that sometimes you have to mentally 'overcome' the desire to not use it at all.Questions...1.)Would I buy it again knowing what I know now?Very tough question because it works GREAT keeping heat out...but NO - I would rather spend a few more hours researching to find something half as thick that packs away smaller. Even if that means the car will be hotter.2.)Is there anything that I would change to make this product better?Yes, so many things, but the main problem is the fact that it's so STIFF & THICK. It forces it to have to 'roll-up' for storage, instead of 'fold-upon-itself' like most sunshades do.3.)Anything else I should add?I think they should print some sort of design on the front. I would put up with the crap if it had an image I liked on the outside.

review/summary: The BEST Chain-Reference Bible in print!
review/text: My old, marked-up Thompson Bible is the &quot;Olde Reliable&quot; that I keep coming back to. I have been using it for over thirty years and find it invaluable to &quot;quick find&quot; verses on nearly evey imaginable topic.On the plus side, are the MANY chain referrences with marginal &quot;PILOT&quot; numbers and brief word discriptions which also serve as mini-commentary on the verses. While the chains may not contain all the referrences a particular denomination may wish to emphasize, it more than make up for it with an ABUNDANCE of referrences most scholars whould never even think to look up! The handy exhaustive indexes, concordance, cross-references and helps enable the user to find nearly every subject in the Bible.On the minus side, 1.) the text is rather small and 2.) it would be benificial if the bold-face marginal headings were included in the OT as well as the New.Overall rating:FIVE-STAR EXCELLENT!!! It is a lifetime of research and study marvelously condensed into a handy-sized volume for both home study and portibility. I heartily recommend it for new Christians as well as those who &quot;think they know it all&quot;. As advertised, it is a Bible that will SURPRISE you. Get it!

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: and that was a welcome relief. We got all 4 as I bought the missing one (#2) separately and we watched them in order. Just when you think what the heck? You see the fury and passion in a human spirit unwilling to be dominated. Meiko is a terrific actress. What was most impressive to us was the inventiveness in the plot and and direction of the storyline in each one considering when these movies were made. I do recommend getting the missing #2 in the series and watching them in order. I thanks the previous posters who steered me to do this. Glad I did.Each one is unique and watching them one after the other is a bit of a treat.

review/summary: Incomplete
review/text: The three films in this set are excellent, absolute classics of the genre. But because this set is incomplete, what is the point? They should be watched in order to really understand the story, and to see Nami's experiences in the order in which they played out. However "Jailhouse 41," the second film is missing. So when you watch the first film, and then skip to the third, (Beast Stable) it makes no sense, because it starts out with "The Scorpion" outside of jail. Part 1 ended with Nami being returned to prison after dispatching the men who raped her, and the cop who used her. Not to mention, many consider the missing film to be the best of the series, and is certainly the most artistic. I believe there are copyright problems with "Jailhouse 41," because it is never available. This is a fine set, but i just don't see the point of it being released with the middle part of the story missing. why did they bother?

review/summary: Not the Best...
review/text: I bought this CD expecting it to be the same type of music as the hit (When it Comes)... but when I finally got it, I listened, and kept trying to accept it and appreciate the music... But I still can't bring myself to do so. I will admit that I do, in fact, like "When it Comes". Its got a good guitar line and chord progressions - even good vocals. In the rest of the CD, Tyler's voice is husky and "wannabe" country. Another okay song is "The Letter Song"... although I will admit that I cringe every time he says, "I can be romantic, I just gotsta try to be." To sum it up, I guess I'll say that if you like pop-country, this is probably for you. Otherwise, make sure you listen to all the samples first and you're sure you'll like it, because for me, it wasn't worth the money.Over and out.

I have a wide variety of music in my large cd collection (some examples are Elvis, the White Stripes, the Killers, Usher, U2, Ben Jelen, and the Stereophonics), and I'm always looking for new music in all genres. When I first heard When It Comes, I knew Tyler Hilton would quickly become one of my favorite artists. He is a rare artist today who combines the rock from the past with a blend of the adult contemporary of today and still maintains a refreshing sound that his own. This EP is amazing, and I know when his full album comes out in September it will be remarkable. I highly recommend Tyler Hilton's EP as well as his upcoming Tracks of... release!

review/text: Thank goodness for Tyler Hilton! His music is so amazing! When I first bought this EP, I wasn't sure what to expect from this brand new artist, however, now it's probably the best cd I own! Despite having only 4 songs, it keeps the listener interested because they're so upbeat. His voice is so soothing, and his guitar playing is impeccable! I absolutely love this cd and reccommend it to everyone!!

review/text: Tyler Hilton....a name you might not know now, but for SURE will within the upcoming months! With his upcoming CD "The Tracks Of...," Tyler's storming the music scene. He showcases some of these songs on his self-titled EP. From the bouncy, singalong "When it comes," reminiscent of summer evening drives and nights at the local diner with friends, he takes us into a universal breakup story in "Pink and Black." "Letter Song' and "Slide" are both singable tunes, but simultaneously give way to showcase Tyler's extremely proficient guitar skills. This is a must-own!

He's very talented and plays alot of music that anyone can relate to. His style of music is very unique but very catchy. If you like to feel for music...get up and dance... or just relax...he's def got it all! His style can be related to Hanson, Gavin Degraw, Johhny Lang, and Ryan Cabera. Nice mix huh? He's defenetly worth the money!!!! :) he's too cute too!!!! &#60;3

review/text: This music is awsome!!!!! I first heard Tyler when I was at a Hanson concert he was the opening act. Before that I had never heard of him. His performance was amazing and so when he was done we went out to get his autograph. He was so sweet he signed the date and my name as well and was gracious enough to do it on my Hanson tour book becuase I had not been able to get anything of his yet. Anyway he is a great person and his music is absolutely awsome. I highly recomend this cd!!!!!Melinda

review/summary: IMPRESSED with Tyler Hilton! :)
review/text: Tyler Hilton is one of those people who is absolutely IMPRESSIVE from the moment you either meet him or hear him for the first time. Recently while on a roadtrip in Tulsa, OK ... I basially ran into Ty and to be honest I had never heard of him before that moment ... but the girls standing near sure had :) Anyways, he handed me a sampler of his music and after he left I decided to give it a spin in my cd player. I was expecting it to be okay but to my suprise I was blown away!!! It was absolutely amazing. I loved "When It Comes" & "Rollin Home".His voice suits his musical style vey well. Its definetely something I would not only buy but could listen to all day! :)Well later that day Ty came back and I got to give him my first reaction: (all I could say was), "IMPRESSIVE." In conclusion, I would have to say that Tyler Hilton, Ty as I like to call him is an all around wonderful person and well the fact that he shares his incredible love for music with people like me makes him all the more enjoyable!!!!! His cd comes out September 14th so if you haven't done so already ORDER IT! :) I promise you won't be disappointed.(Ty, from the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!)-JennyZ

review/summary: Smooth Jazz
review/text: If you like jazz or new age music you should enjoy this CD. A nice combination of sax, piccolo, piano, and other instruments in a instrumental collection of easy listening jazz. Fans of Jim Brickman will probably like it. I first ran across this in the 80s on cassette. I have listened to it ever since and didn't see it on CD until today when I found it here. I started to order it through Amazon but I noticed other sellers here are substancially cheaper and indicate there CDs are new. I will let you know if the seller is reliable.Addendum: I got my CD yesterday and I suggest purchasing this CD from smokymtnbooks. They sent my CD in a timely manner and they are very reasonably priced. The cover is not the one shown here, however it is the orginal cover from when the cassette and then CD first came out years ago. It includes the name of the artists. This is not a copy or reproduction. It is the orignal CD. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: I Never Knew You Could Make Techno That Sounded Depressing!
review/text: I never realized that Biohazard/Resident Evil 2 had some great music until I bought the soundtrack. After hearing some of its scores, I realized that the music was worth more than just a video game sequel in which the original quite possible had the WORST soundtrack ever. Anyway, after realizing how good the music was in Biohazard/Resident Evil 2, it wasn't long at all until I got this CD, and once again I heard great music...albeit quite a tad different than the original.There are more than simple differences that prevented me from giving this album a perfect score. To start off, there are only four tracks, each ranging from about five to seven minutes in length. Also, there are really only three non-drum-based melodies in this CD, each one used at least once per track. One of those tracks I don't even recognize. And to top it all off, Chris Redfield, who isn't even in the game, makes a cameo voice-appearance in two of the tracks. I didn't even like Chris that much! True, that may change after CODE: Veronica's release for the PS2.However, while being four tracks in length, and repetitive I might add, the music never gets tiring, as strange as it may seem. You never get tired of any of the melodies until you've heard it all the way through, and you regenerate your ability to listen to it all over again after only a few hours. The two melodies that I do recognize are &quot;Secure Location&quot; (the saving room theme), and &quot;T-1&quot; (Scenario 2's Tyrant attack music - type one). The remixes of them sound excellent, with very high sound quality and alignment with the eerie sounds and drum beats. Also, Chris's words, although strangely spoken by him, sound surprisingly poetic, even though the words are also brewing with power and madness. He says some lines in his track like: &quot;Life and death, they both have their purpose. Leaving a trail of destruction is both easier, and more effective when the ultimate goal is not disclosed.&quot; Finally, the &quot;Secure Location&quot; remix always sounds hollow, but a good, purposeful hollow. As you listen, you feel a chill go down your spine, as you can really imagine yourself being the last human alive. Accompanied with it is a great dancing beat and awesome mind warping sounds that's great for Halloween parties!All in all, this CD is high paced, poetic and saddening. I never knew that you could have such a wide range of emotions in single short tracks, but somehow it has been done. With this CD, you get four awesome tracks, and as such, this CD is a blast while it lasts.

review/summary: Essential reading and an excellent resource
review/text: I would hope (probably in vain) that Lawrence Harrison's "The Central Liberal Truth" be required reading for all those involved in the making of foreign policy, especially those within the government of the United States. I specifically mention the United States government, not because other countries need not reflect on their foreign policies but simply, as the world's only remaining superpower, American foreign policy is crucial and virtually defines the status of contemporary international relations. While recognizing that the history of the United States is fraught with foreign policy mistakes and disasters, it must also be recognized that it does not stand alone in this area. The past two centuries have experienced many bullies in the global arena and, at least, the United States has not been responsible for as much human destruction as that brought about by Germany under Hitler, the Soviet Union under Stalin, and Communist China under Mao. I will not join those who think the U.S.A. is always wrong, the greatest threat to world peace, or the planet's "Great Satan."Now, with that disclaimer taken care of and before I get into Harrison's book, I need to bring up something which I found confusing at the outset. The book's description includes the following statement: "Harrison rejects the Bush administration's doctrine that 'the values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society.'" I assume that this inclusion had the author's approval. Nowhere in the book, however, do I find a definitive rejection of this so-called "Bush doctrine." The actual text in the book (p. 2) is this and it relates to the influence of "culture": "It [culture] is also a key factor in foreign policy, with particular relevance to the Bush administration's keystone policy of promoting democracy: '[the] values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society.' If culture matters in making democracy work...and as the disappointing experience of the United States in promoting democracy...suggests, then the keystone is likely to crumble under the pressure of cultures averse to democracy, as in the Arab countries..."I'm sorry, but I don't see this as a "rejection" of such a "doctrine" (or "principle" as I would call it). I agree that making democracy "work" in a country that has no history of democratic ideas or institutions or is fundamentally averse to democracy in the first place might be virtually impossible, but that does not mean that the ideal of the "values of freedom" are not universally "right and true." I would like to interpret Harrison to mean that, while the "ideal" is universally true and desirable, it is not a "realistic" and immediate goal at the present time in the current international situation. After all, it took England centuries to evolve its democratic institutions and the United States itself was built on this tradition and it still took the U.S. many years after its founding to give women the right to vote and grant civil rights to certain minorities. In fact, America is still in the process of evolution in this regard. Bush's foreign policy regarding promoting democracy in the Arab lands may be naive and misguided (as I believe it is), but the ideal, in my opinion, remains viable even though practically unrealizable in the present moment.The major reason I think this book is vitally important is because it emphasizes "culture" as a prime ingredient in constructing any foreign policy. Harrison defines culture as "the body of values, beliefs, and attitudes that members of a society share," and which is influenced by many factors such as religious practices, educational systems, information sources, interpersonal relationships, and so on. For all too long, in my view, foreign policies have been shaped only by politics, economics, and military considerations. This I believe has led to the disastrous results we see in America's attempt to change other societies into "progressive democracies," particularly in Latin America and the Middle East. What I am trying to say is that churning out a foreign policy without considering the "culture" of the country toward which it is directed is most likely doomed to failure. This also explains, in my opinion, why our current Iraqi occupation is problematic (to say the least!) and will lead to one of two outcomes: (1) American troops will occupy Iraq for many decades and forcibly "impose" a sham democracy, or (2) American troops will be pulled from Iraq and the country will revert to tribal and religious warfare, resulting most likely in an authoritarian government of some sort. (Bush would have been better off consulting philosophers, theologians, and anthropologists before invading Iraq and then deciding it was probably a hopeless cause.)Harrison's book contains much valuable information. I was especially impressed with the chart in chapter two illustrating a "Typology of Progress-Prone and Progress-Resistant Cultures." Four main categories are included -- Worldview, Values/Virtues, Economic Behavior, Social Behavior -- and these contain 25 items under an appropriate category. The chapter then discusses in some detail each of the items included, bringing together much recent research from a wide variety of resources. Also of particular interest to me was his chapter on "Religions and Progress" which also contains a "Religion Summary Chart" with references to such items as literacy, fertility, freedom, corruption, etc., delineated by religious category and country. He discusses various religious traditions and indicates how they are either progress-promoting or progress-resistent. And he provides the empirical data to support his conclusions and generalizations. There are a lot more good things to say about "The Central Liberal Truth" but, unfortunately, word-count restraints prohibit me from discussing them.Let me, however, conclude with this evaluation. This is an "excellent" and, moreover, thoroughly "realistic" book on this particular subject. Furthermore, in my view, American foreign policy will not be consummately "realistic" in any sense until the suggestions proffered by Harrison and his colleagues in the numerous studies cited in the book are taken seriously and put into practice. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Reality is the cure for ideology.
review/text: I must say that reading this book was a quantum leap from the last several political books that I've read, which were written by pundits. This book is a bit dry at times, but it contains real reasearch about reality.The "take home lesson" I got out of reading this book is:First, "Freedom and Democracy" isn't for every nation because a nation, or culture, must have certain values internalized before freedom or democracy can work. This is a rebuke to ideologues on the "right" who think that we can superimpose our style of government on any nation out there.However, this book is also a stinging rebuttal of the leftist who believes that John Lennon's "Imagine" expressed the ideal for humanity. "Imagine no religion..." No, we really can't afford to "imagine no religion" because it seems that decentralized Christianity (Protestantism) gave the world the most "progressive" culture that has even been. And, we can't "Imagine no possessions" because it is the possibility of home ownership that gives people a stake in their society.Finally, this book delivers a body blow to "multiculturalism". Some cultures are sick, and this book explains how they can get better.I could go on, but my point is that an exhaustive study has been completed that ties culture to "progress", and it's probably not what anyone who is narcissistically attached to a particular political ideology wants to hear. However, it is in this book, which I would recommend to anyone interested in politics and culture.

review/summary: Foreign Policy Makers Must Read!
review/text: Professor Harrison's book is a well researched, timely and necessary study of why some cultures do better than others and how outside forces may or may not affect change when desired. The cases described within are necessary background for decisions being made today,and I sincerely hope our policymakers will study them. This book is a perfect complement to the Jared Diamond thesis and one should not be read without the other. A pivotal book for our times.

review/summary: Great idea, poor execution
review/text: I was cheering on this book through the first two chapters. He was absolutely convincing to me -- culture explains so much better than any other reason why some countries do so much better than others. Harrison came up with 25 possible cultural factors that explain why some countries become developed and others don't. I was looking forward to further discussion and analysis on which factors were most important, using some kind of quantitative analysis.Then the wheels came off. Harrison dived right into the methodology of changing the cultures of undeveloped countries, without even figuring out which factors truly made a difference. It seemed to me that he wasn't really interested in making a definitive case that culture was the reason for underdevelopment. Harrison was already convinced of this in his head, and he had his own ideas on which of the 25 factors were the most important ones. It was just a matter of figuring out how to change these cultures. He is so caught up in the culture of development economics that he makes the same mistake as everyone else in the field. He knows what is wrong; he just needs to fix it; the hell with more study. I believe the failure of these international economic developers for the last 50 years make it apparent that we need to look at the situation more clearly before rushing in half-cocked.I was most disappointed in the third chapter, when he discusses methods of changing culture by indoctrinating the kids in developing country schools with First World values. I cringed at this idea for three reasons:-- Harrison hadn't shown that the values he was trying to inculcate were in fact the values that would bring development to the country,--He didn't show that schooling of kids in this manner would have the effect he wanted of changing the culture when everything else in society pointed in the other direction--I was dubious about the ethics of subverting the kids in a country to values in opposition to the adults.The rest of the book consisted of brief discussions of many different areas of the World, explaining how their culture was deficient for development, or ways to change said culture. The reviews of each area were both too brief to be satisfying, and totally lacking in quantitative analysis and statistics. In other words, the ideas and suggestions were just essays by people in his organization on each area. They were totally subjective and thus not very credible, in my mind.Harrison never says how the changers of culture will succeed in infiltrating the societies he wants to change. He wants to change the values of the next generation in each country; but why would the current generation that is currently running the country let him in to make these changes? He has several examples of situations where people have gone in and tried to make these changes, but he never explains why the people there let him do it. My guess is that he plans to use Western money to bribe undeveloped countries to let them make adjustments to education, media etc. Kind of like, "We'll give you all this development money if you let us set up these schools." I think this will rarely work in making real change in a country. The governments will take the money and then make sure the initiatives don't work as planned.I think the only way to get this cultural change to take place is to convince the elites in each country to believe that cultural change will in fact result in economic growth. To do that, someone needs to do a much better job than this book to show the evidence that certain values and behaviors correlate highly with economic development, and that certain other values and behavior do the opposite. This book makes a great beginning thesis, now someone needs to do the quantitative analysis. Of course many elites won't be convinced no matter how good the evidence, but there should be enough to move the project forward. Eventually the success of those following the program will convince more countries to follow along. Certainly this path will be long and difficult, but it will work better than the current haphazard approach of trying to change cultures in opposition to elites. Besides, the imperialistic approach is kind of contradictory to the "progressive" values he is seeking to impart.

review/summary: Great Book on Culture and Politics
review/text: This is a great book, especially for those who have readGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societiesby Jared Diamond (as one reviewer already pointed out). It provides an excellent starting point for anyone interested in the issue as to why some countries are essentially predisposed towards dominating others.The funny thing, and somewhat contrary to the title of the book, is that it is not exactly liberal friendly (at least in the context of its normal usage). The premise of the book is essentially that culture does matter but some cultures lend themselves, by virtue of their values and ideals, towards cultural stances that do not promote democracy, human rights, or economic development. I reiterate, which some negative reviewers have complained about, is that this book is not liberal in the traditional sense so that those with a cultural relativism stance are bound to take issue with Harrison's views. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.

review/summary: A Companion Read To GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL
review/text: If you like books that offer explanations for humankind's big questions, this book attemps such. Depending on how much stock you put in Harrison's well-conceived and sufficiently supported (in my opinion) thoery, it can be construed to either add to or take precedence over Diamond's GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL. I think together these books help to explain the world's current political situation (mess). Unlike Diamond's "geography is fate" analysis, much can be accomplished politically to correct Harrison's "culture is fate" explanation. Culture relativists, hackneyed liberals, and Bushian neo-cons will all take offense - that in itself may be sufficient reason to read it. The writing and editing could have been better, but because there were many contributors this is somewhat excusable.

review/summary: For political scientists and sociologists, not economists
review/text: I found this book to be too diffuse in its coverage to be of much use to me. It tries to cover 25 cultural factors for many situations and is generally lacking in quantitative analysis. I found it hard to see how the various cultural factors are related, and what their importance is in specific situations. Thus I believe that political scientists and sociologists will find the book of greater value than economists. Perhaps it tries to do too much at one time.The Spring 2006 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives has a symposium of articles on cultural economics, and I found David Landes' article on the development of China and Europe over the last millennium, and the economic analysis of a few cultural factors like "trust" by Guiso et al to be of greater interest to me as an economist because of their specific and quantitative nature. Since Kahneman and Tversky did their pioneering work, a whole new field of cultural or psychological economics has been opened and it may take many years before we have a comprehensive economics based on people as they are and not on "economic man." Certainly "culture matters", but it is too soon for an economic synthesis of the field.

review/summary: Too simplistic
review/text: While Mr. Harrison makes some extremely valid arguments in this book , I wish he had also explored why the Anglo-protestant culture , which he holds up as"best in class" went about enslaving the world and what impact this has had on various countries , whom they enslaved.Perhaps some of the progress those Anglo-protestant societies have made, is due to the fact that they exploited other countries and other peoples and not so much their work ethic as Mr. Harrison seems to suggest

review/summary: The Seeds of Affluence and Poverty
review/text: The odd mix of mutually exclusive words in the title was the first thing about this book that grabbed my attention. The meaning becomes clear as you read the various examples in the book: the central truth is that liberal programs don't work. As these programs try to mandate change, they invariably produce consequences that are the opposite of what they were supposed to produce.Harrison would probably disagree with what I just said, because throughout the book he uses "liberal" as a positive label--and he concludes the book by pushing leftist opinions that don't really derive from the rest of the book. Yes, there's a connection if you want to read that into the book--but the author's "central" conclusion is tacked on, rather than proven.Let's briefly address this label of "liberal." In the USA, those calling themselves liberals have given us such enormous taxes (128 taxes on a single loaf of bread) that Americans work 50% more hours each week and take 25% of the annual vacation time as their European counterparts to maintain a similar standard of living (yes, we do have big homes and big cars--but that doesn't account for most of it). These people are actually "statists"--they believe that the government really is here to help you. Many statists also call themselves conservatives. Statism characterized the Clinton administration and it characterizes the Bush administration. One was "liberal," the other is "conservative"--both have grown government enormously at great cost, but with no discernable benefit.Another point I want to clear up is the issue of exporting freedom. The author derides the notion that the USA can export freedom to the Middle East. He states cultural differences as the reason we cannot do this. Well, he is assuming we have something to export. But do we?The United States spends more on its military than the next five nations combined, but the number of people on the IRS payroll exceeds the number of folks in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines combined. That has some rather serious implications. Try seeing what freedoms you have if these people dig their claws into you. The facts don't matter, due process is absent, the Bill of Rights is suspended, and you could lose your ability to feed, clothe, and shelter yourself.John Graver has interviewed wealthy expatriates and found that every one of them cited the IRS as the number one reason for moving abroad. Anyone who has been caught up in the machinery of this criminal-infested agency understands why. The GAO reports each year on IRS employee behavior that normal people would be locked up for (such as stealing 4300 computers from their own offices or kidnapping toddlers at gunpoint). And yet, these demonstrably dishonest people have the absolute authority (regardless of statute or principle) to act as judge, jury, and executioner over people being tried for real or perceived "deficiencies." People on trial for multiple homicide have more rights than people deemed "deficient" by the IRS. Another country noted for allowing the morally bankrupt this level of unbridled power over "deficient" people on such a massive scale was Hitler's Germany.So much for having freedom to export. We are exporting citizens who seek freedom.The author reveals a bit of his own idealism and naivet&eacute; regarding these two issues. But once we get past those, we can see he has dug into an entire body of knowledge that is routinely ignored by people in power--regardless of whether those people are liberal or conservative. And for this we can be thankful.Harrison looks at broad trends, and--admittedly--draws broad conclusions. But as you look at the cases, you can see these conclusions are, by and large, reflected in reality. Harrison also does a good job of explaining what the effects are of various religions, cultural taboos, and attitudes. He looks at the effects of female literacy, punctuality, and trust--or the lack of these. These various factors flavor the stew that gives a country its culture.As I read this book, I kept nodding my head: "Yes, that makes sense" or "That's a well-supported point." I kept feeling I was learning how culture is more than a mere factor in the progress of a nation--it's a determinant. Then, toward the end of the book, we see the real reason Harrison had the word "liberal" in the title. Harrison ties the whole book into the standard commentary of the left, just (thinly) disguised a bit.I have read several books that, had the author restrained himself from needlessly adding in leftist statements, would have been just fine. These authors have an almost Pavlovian approach to writing--no matter what they write about, they have to either lace the whole piece with leftist opinion or write a fine book and then cap it with leftist conclusions that really have nothing to do with the book.As I said in the beginning of this review, the real problem Harrison is talking about is statism. We get it from the left and from the right. Liberalism is an enabler of statism, not a solution to it. Statism is the belief that the government actually solves problems--and the more government you have, the better. This belief has dominated politics since the early part of the last century. It failed most dramatically perhaps with the Soviet Union. But it's also failed in the United States, and we have the flight of capital and talent to prove that.If Harrison writes a second edition, my recommendation would be to limit the book to its central topic of culture. Also, the subtitle "How Politics Can Change a Culture and Save It From Itself" was not evident in the book--at least, not to me. Removing the Bush-bashing would make the political aspects of this book very minor. Renaming it to "The Central Cultural Truth" would more accurately reflect its contents.If you are a leftist, liberal, or Bush basher, you'll love this book because it contains the normal party line and you can mistakenly point to that party line as being supported by the book. Similarly, you could point to the ocean, say it's wet, and then conclude that the leftist view is thus well-supported. Either way is about as good. If you are a conservative, you might begin to see that statism isn't helping your cause at all. And on that, the author has plenty of evidence.If you want to understand the effects of culture, attitude, and other factors on how affluent or poor a nation is, you'll like this book until almost the end. It's got a wealth of good information and thoughtful analysis. Just take the leftist part with a grain of salt, and you'll find this book rather satisfying.A note on the writing: form is important, as it dictates readability. Fortunately, this book scored very well on substance and on form. This book actually uses Standard Written English (SWE). This was a refreshing change from the Pidgin English that so many of today's authors slop onto our reading palettes. The care taken in writing this book shows that the author and publisher actually cared about the reader. That's a huge plus.

review/summary: Our burden
review/text: Harrison's mind strikes me as one still anchored in colonialism, albeit, a new, hip, updated version. It would do us all well to first read Rudyard Kipling's poem, The White Man's Burden (1899) before we dive into Mr. Harrison's book; the real purpose of which, I suspect, is to save the dark-skinned "Half-devil and half-child" heathens from themselves.

review/summary: My favorite for 30 years
review/text: I had the amazing good fortune to be acquainted with Bob, and Gary, and Doug, when they were playing lounges in Des Moines. Many a night I sat and nursed a beer, and laughed and cried to their music. He writes some of his songs, but when he does Lightfoot or Guy Clark, or whoever, I almost always like his version better. I wore out the album, and the first CD, and still listen to him almost every day. And he still makes me laugh and cry. He's gone now, but he lives on in mellow tones, and silly giggles. Sometimes I can even hear myself in the background singing along, or laughing. He's been my favorite music since the first time I heard him 30 some years ago. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Love this chair!
review/text: I don't get all this complaining about cleaning the chair. I have a 9 month old self-feeder who drops and smears stuff all the time and I just haven't had any issues with cleaning. I'm a working mom and don't have tons of time, so maybe I'm just less precise about cleaning than other moms...I certainly don't use a toothbrush or qtip to clean every single crevice and I don't care if there are a few stray crumbs between the slats for a few days until I get around to brushing them out. I think it's easy to brush away crumbs from the pad and wood and then just use a wet paper towel to get the sticky parts. And even if food gets on the pad--who cares? Wipe it off and move on with your life. I'd rather get down on the floor with my cute baby and play with blocks than spend a lot of time worrying about crumbs. I wash the pad maybe once every 2-3 weeks and that's been fine. The fabric is such that it doesn't show dirt too readily. We put the tray insert into the dishwasher every night and then just clean off the sides of the tray and chair with 409 it's no big deal.The tiny amount of effort is worth it for a sturdy and stylish chair that fits our decor and doesn't take up very much space in our small dining room. The only down side is that our large and tall 9 month old doesn't sit up very high in it compared to some smaller plastic & vinyl chairs BUT the upside of this is that we know a large and tall 2.5 year old who still uses her chair (same design, earlier color/style). I definitely recommend this chair for families living in small and stylish spaces and who don't have to have every inch of the house 100% spotless.

review/summary: Pretty , but not the best
review/text: I don't like to write bad reviews but I want to save someone else the time and money. I loved the way this high chair looked. So we got it. It is pretty but it is hard to clean, hard to buckle and hard to get my baby into. There are allot of crevices to get food out of. The wooden slats, the notches the tray locks into and under the t-bar. The strap is very hard to get a squirming baby restrained into. One feeding and the Fabric cover is soiled and needs to be cleaned, they recommend air drying it, so the cover is only good for breakfast. Without the cover my baby slides right down and I have to constantly straighten her up. I have a nice sized kitchen and it does take quite a bit of room. It is bulky which means it is sturdy but makes it hard to move if you need to. The T-bar is nice for snack time but it is hard to cram my one year old into. The tray is a little high so it is at my baby's arm pit area. She is not that short either. The restraint is a loose t-shaped nylon strap, which she sits on half the time and I have to fish under her but to find. My friend recommended the Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat which is portable, straps onto ANY chair and is great for eating out and traveling. I ended up getting two (one for the inlaws and one for home) and wish I would have listened and got the Healthy Care as my main high chair first. Save your money and energy on another chair.

review/summary: great features but beware of difficulty cleaning
review/text: This high chair has some great features - storage space for bibs and washcloths, removable fabric liner for easy machine washing, removable tray for easy cleaning.But it is very difficult to clean the seat. My son always wear a bib with a pocket to catch what doesn't make it to his mouth. Even so, a fair amount of little stuff ends up in the cracks on the side of the chair. And though they look great, the wooden slats are way too close to clean effectively. We wipe down everything else after each meal but there is usually still dried food stuck there until we get out a spray bottle and some serious elbow grease!It is a good-looking chair. But if you are looking for a wood chair, I'd look for other ones. I wish we had gotten one that sat directly at the table with adjustable heights.

review/text: Things we like:Looks great, we love the look of a wooden high chairPad is easy to remove to cleanThe snack tray is great for, well, snacks, and we used before he was self feeding and having a big tray just got in the way.Tray is easy to use and cleanStorage space underneath is really helpfulThe pull out spaces on the tray are good for holding food out of baby's reach (at least until they are over a year old)Things we don't:The chair is hard to clean, we almost all agree.The straps don't come off and they can't be cleaned except with a sponge.The straps need to be arranged correctly before you place the baby inThe wood has been chipping so we are starting to lose the "looks great" part of this.The "extra" tray was useless as it only covered the top and we managed to make a mess all over the sides most of the time so we then had two things to clean. We never use that extra tray anymore.That being said, we've used a few other highchairs at other people's homes and y'know what? They are almost all hard to clean. Vinyl is nice because it wipes up easier, but it is usually permanently attached so you can never throw it in the washer. There are also going to be nooks and crannies where a vinyl seat meets the rest of this chair. And even with the chipping wood, it still looks better than a plastic chair in my opinion (why do I care what the highchair looks like at all? I don't know)All in all, we like the chair, but don't love it as much as we thought we would.

review/summary: Poor Quality High Chair. Save your money!
review/text: This highchair is lame! Save your money for something better. I purchased this highchair because I wanted a nice-looking wooden high chair to match our kitchen. It really is a beautiful highchair but I wish I would have purchased more of an heirloom piece. We have owned it about a year and a half and it looks terrible and is so poorly made. Here are the problems:1. Varnish/Finish is chipping and flaking all over the place, leaving bare patches.2. Varnish/Finish is buckling/cracking on the back of the chair where logo is.I would highly recommend not buying this highchair. If you want something beautiful that will last, this is not the ticket! I am almost embarassed to have this eye-sore sitting in our dining room. :( Bad investment! For the money, you would be able to purchase something much more durable from a company that knows something about how to finish furniture. It may be solid wood, but I don't know what materials they used to finish it.Also, this piece is really hard to clean. You may not see this as a big deal, but after 3 meals a day, it gets pretty tedious - even if you only do it once a day. Food is always getting stuck in the cracks and it is a mess.Lastly, the three-point-harness system on this highchair is substandard. I have had a difficult time keeping my kids in this thing! One time I walked around the corner and my daughter had her leg over the edge of the highchair. She had gotten out and was about to topple to the ground.This review probably sounds really dramatic. I just hope that if you are considering this highchair that you will learn from my mistakes. Read the other reviews and listen to your inner voice (it should tell you to look for a different product).....

review/summary: Attractive classic high chair
review/text: If you would rather not have one of those plastic technicolor abominations for a high chair, this is a good option. True, you may not be able to just hose the thing down after every meal, but with a little daily effort it is possible to keep it reasonably clean, if not immaculate. More thorough weekly cleanings are a good idea, and take perhaps all of five minutes. Likewise, the back does not fold down like the modern chairs to ease the insertion of a resistant toddler, but that has not been much of an issue for us either. Seems to me that people have been putting children into highchairs of this basic design for at least several hundred years, so it surely must be possible. Our daughter is not a wriggler and climber, so we haven't had to use the belt system much, but it certainly seems adequate. We don't leave her unattended in the chair anyway. In sum, if you want a chair that might actually be worth keeping around for another 25 years to give to your children for your grandchildren, this is a fine piece of quality furniture. If you want all the plastic bells and whistles on something that will almost certainly end up in a landfill in five years, this is obviously not the chair for you!.

review/summary: The seatbelt is terrible!
review/text: My sister bought this for her son, then passed it on to me when he outgrew it. We both hate it! My other sister has the same one and she doesn't like it either.I like the look. I love the tray inserts and the pop out cup holders. I like that it has a mini tray when both the others are removed. The finish has held up just fine on mine.I also don't like cleaning the side slats, but I'd deal with that for the look if the safety restraint was better.The padded cover is piling. It looks faded and worn, but it has been washed a lot.But the big con to me is the safety restraint. The seatbelt is ridiculously difficult. I've owned several feeding chairs, and this one is by far the most difficult to adjust to fit. My daughter is constantly standing in the chair. She wiggles out so quickly since she is very skinny. My sisters have both had the same issues. The other day she completely fell out of the chair. It is just frustrating and scary. I can't turn my back on her for a second when she is in it. I don't think she likes the tray height either, and that is why she is always trying to stand up. I am going to purchase a chair that has a seatbelt like you'd find in a stroller, a five point harness that will go up over her shoulders. One that will attach to our kitchen chair.I took this out to the garage today. No more high chair for us. It just isn't worth the risk.

review/text: The high chair looks great when it first comes out of the box but it is all down hill after that. It is impossible to keep clean. The finish is flaking off, after less than 6 months of use. It is not worth the struggle to keep up. If you already have it, call the customer service number and order a second chair pad. It is only $12 and does help to be able to switch out when one is in the wash.

review/summary: 3x's not the charm
review/text: After having hand me down high chairs with my first two children, I thought I would indugle and register for this one with my third. It was a gift and as far as looks go I was super excited to finally have the "wooden" high chair I had always wanted. Unfortunately I should have done a little more research and not gone on just looks alone. It was big, bulky (rubber sliders on the bottom make it hard to manuever in the kitchen) and in complete agreement with other parents, it is very difficult to clean. My little guy couldn't use it till he was almost 5 mos old because of the lack of recline option, and the fact that the tray is up so high, his poor little arms couldn't lift high enough above the tray to play with toys or grab food when learning to self feed. The seatbelt is worthless in this and I have a travel chair liner that velcros behind the back holding my son in place. He is now 10 mos old and I have taken it to the garage in exchange for a friends highchair that her son has outgrown. It is exactly what I should have registered for in the first place, saving my friends who purchased it for me time and money. So in hopes of saving other parents/friends/family time and money do not waste it on this highchair and encourge moms-to-be to really take all things into consideration, not just looks. It looks nice, but isn't very practical at all..

review/summary: Do you rember what happened to the fax machine in Office Space?
review/text: Like many naive first time parents, we bought this high chair because of its looks. When we first saw the Eddie Bauer high chair, we thought that it was perfect because it matched with our kitchen cabinets. However, I have to say that this is probably the worst purchase we ever made. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: It looks good and matches our furniture.Cons: -The padding is difficult to clean. Most highchairs have plastic padding that can be easily wiped. After the second wash, the padding started to knot up.-It is easy for a baby to bang their head on the wood when not using the padding.-There are no wheels on the chair, making it difficult to maneuver the chair during feeding time.-It weighs a ton.-There is no way to sit and infant on this chair because it cannot be reclined.-Baby legs can get stuck in the gap between the seat and the bottom side of the table.-Finally, it is very easy for a baby to stand on the chair. The seatbelt is worthless.We had the hardest time trying to teach our daughter to eat solids because she was constantly trying to stand up on the chair. Unfortunately, we continued feeding our daughter with this chair until she was 17 months old. We felt that it would be a waste to purchase another chair since we spent $120 on this piece of...Finally, we caved in and bought a cheap Evenflo expressions from BabiesRUs (around $60) since it had great reviews. This chair made all the difference. My daughter can no longer stand up while eating. She is such a good eater now. After we bought this chair, my wife took the Eddie Bauer to our backyard and, unfortunately, the chair suffered the same fate as the fax machine in Office Space.The moral of the story...do not buy a baby product because it looks good. Make sure you do your research and buy items based on practicality.

review/summary: Looks nice, low functionality
review/text: I have used this highchair for 2 kids now and finally decided to sell it because I did not like it. It's a beautiful chair and looks great in the kitchen. It's much nicer looking than the 'plastic' ones you see. What I don't like about this chair is the day-to-day functionality of it. It does not adjust, at all. As the baby gets older, I want a chair that tilts, adjusts, etc-- and this does not do that. Also, it is very heavy and hard to move; it does not slide on the floor well at all. The seatbelt is clumsy and a pain to put through the fabric cover when you take the cover on or off for cleaning. After being used multiple times, the velcro that fastens the fabric cover down will no longer stick so every time you lift your child out of the highchair, the cover comes with them. I found myself very frustrated with this chair.I would not recommend this chair to anyone. I do think it's pretty though if you are going strictly by looks!

review/summary: Happy with our chair
review/text: We are extremely happy with this high chair. I wanted this one from the get-go but was scared off by all the bad reviews about safety..and everything else. Eventually we bought it anyway, and haven't had a single problem. It is absolutley beautiful. My 10 month old self feeds in it. Cleaning it has not been an issue..I wipe it down right away, and vaccum with a crevice tool when I vacuum the floors, in case I missed something in the cracks. We do not use the pad...the only time my son ever hit his head, he laughed and did it again..it is not harmful. We haven't used the safety strap, yet have no trouble with him sitting safely in it...(our son is a walker, and occassionally tries to stand up in the chair, but I just sit him back down or take him out). Beautiful chair, looks great in the kitchen, my son crawls underneath it and uses it like a fort:) This chair just proves that everything is just a matter of opinion.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: I love this high chair. It came mostly assembled only needing four screws or so. I was able to do this by myself, for once not needing my husband to put everything together! The wood stain is beautiful and coordinates great with our dining room furniture. The quality is also superb. I love too that it comes with an extra tray. If I could change anything it would maybe that the plastic tray didn't have to come completely off to get baby inside. (You could just extend the tray out as far as possible and slide baby between.) Instead maybe be attached at one end and rotate upward. I don't know though if they even make high chairs that do that. But overall this is a fantastic high chair!

review/summary: Great Chair
review/text: I was slightly skeptical when I purchased this chair after reading the reviews. We eat all of our meals in our dining room, so I thought this chair would look much nicer than a plastic one. I couldn't have been more pleased with the appearance. Clean up isn't that hard either.The only draw back from purchasing a wooden chair is they don't recline. Your child has to be able to sit up before you can start using the chair.

review/summary: eddie bauer high chair
review/text: I am quite pleased with the Eddie Bauer wooden highchair. I read some reviews before I purchased it and most people complained about the cleaning of it. I don't get the problem. Any high chair is difficult to keep clean as babies are quite messy. I just wipe it up after each use. I like the looks of the wood and it is a spacesaver for a smaller home.The only complaint I have is that the pad doesn't go to the top of the back of the chair. My grandaughter has hit or bumped her head as we are getting her in it, so we had to but a small homemade pad over the top of the back. I think since I have received mine, Eddie Bauer may have changed that feature. I wish I could purchase the new chair pad.

review/summary: compact, but hard to clean
review/text: We have a small house, and really wanted two of these high chairs for our twins. Space-wize, they are great; they have a small footprint and look nice along side the rest of our furniture.The 2nd tray and the slide-out cup holders are a great addition to this high chair. The shelf under the seat is a great place to store bibs.The downside of the Eddie Bauer high chair is that its difficult to clean. I have toddler twins, I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning their high chairs with a toothbrush! The slats on the side of the seat are close together and food gets slopped in between them at every meal. If you don't throughly clean this up after each meal, it dries and is difficult to get clean.Another downside is my kids never really fit well into these highchairs. They were always too short for the tray, and the tray was always too far away as opposed to other highchairs. This helped create even more food mess!

review/summary: Hard to clean!
review/text: I agree with everyone else who says this chair is hard to clean. I bought the lighter colored wood chair, which really makes the grime build up noticeable, especially on the foot rest. We clean the high chair all the time, but the wood almost has an absorbency about it and there's just so much you're able to get clean. And I'm not sure why some areas that have been cleaned have a sticky feeling to them except that maybe it's a reaction of the wood to the chemicals in disinfectant wipes. It looks nice, but I wish I had gone with a plastic, easier to clean high chair.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: Like the other reviews I bought this chair because of all the neat features as well as the looks however cleaning it is another story. My daughter is a very messy eater so its always a major chore to clean it up, the cover is always in the wash because of this problem. Like the other reviews the slats are to narrow where you cant get your fingers through and the bar does not come off. Would work well with a double jointed person. Also my daughter has mastered getting out of the straps no matter how tight it is making it very unsafe. A few times Ive caught her standing up in the chair. In addition the finish is not very good either, in the 3 months Ive had this there is alot of marks and wearing on the seat. I wish I had just bought the Chicco Mamma chair like both of my sons had, it would have saved me the hassle. A nice concept but not worth the price.

review/summary: beautiful chair but hard to clean
review/text: This is a great high chair with many neat features. The chair itself is solid hardwood and of fairly heavy weight. A downside to that is the chair isn't easily moved with one hand, which is often necessary since I'm usually holding the baby in the other! But the stain of the wood is very pretty and probably matches a lot of current decor. Its nice to have a highchair that looks good sitting in the corner of the kitchen, rather than so many of the others with the loud colors and cheap plastic. We get many compliments on the looks of the chair.The tray is designed really well with a removable top tray that is dishwasher safe. There are two cupholders that slide out from the main tray to place baby food jars out of baby's reach or to hold a drink, etc. Remove the entire tray and there is a little snack tray to keep the baby busy while preparing dinner. Again, you need to use both hands to manuever the tray since there is a release button on both sides. Having just one button towards the front would make it easier to use while holding baby.As another reviewer pointed out, the big downside to this chair is its hard to clean. Food often gets stuck between the decorative slats on the sides and its hard to get out. The seat cover itself looked worn after just one washing. I prefer the looks of the fabric to vinyl, but they should have chosen a better fabric that's easier to clean.Despite the cons, I believe the chair is still worth 4 stars because it has many redeeming features and looks really great. Definately worth the money considering the amount of use it will get!

review/summary: Great Quality, Perfect Fit, Better View of Gauges
review/text: This windscreen is much better than the original one on my 2007 ZZR600. The double bubble design allows me to see my gauges better and also redirects the wind over my helmet better. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it! It only comes with the windscreen, there are no screws or mounting hardware included. I was able to reuse my OEM mounting hardware but this may not be possible with all bikes. I recommend checking to see what type of hardware your bike currently has so you can purchase new mounting screws if needed. I received it 4 days early and was also very pleased with that. Great quality, easy install, and looks great!+ Direct Fit+ Higher "double bubble" directs wind higher and also allows me to see gauges easier than the OEM windscreen+ The "Zero Gravity" logo seen in the picture is just a sticker and easily peels off with no residue left behind_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. My favorite features are that the small decal is easily removeable and that the double bubble allows me to see my gauges without having to crouch at lower speeds...like in town where I sit more upright than in the twisties. Great product for a great price.

review/summary: Contemporary Manifestations of a Timeless Classic
review/text: "Curiouser and curiouser." "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!" "When _I_ use a word it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less." "You're nothing but a pack of cards!" Even if you don't know the Alice books by Lewis Carroll, chances are you have heard these quotations. The books are so well known that they have, according to one report, been quoted more than any other source except the Bible and Shakespeare. The timelessness of the appeal of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ and _Through the Looking Glass_ can easily be appreciated in the book _Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll in Popular Culture_ (Continuum) by Will Brooker. It is an examination of the manifestations of Alice in the past fifteen or so years, with some attention paid for historic context to the rest of the twentieth century. That there is still lively participation by Alice in many surprising aspects of our modern world is a cheerful reminder of how good the original books are, and Brooker's own witty book gives hope that Alice will always have a role to play in the culture of any age.But Carroll (actually The Reverend Charles L. Dodgson) himself has in the past decade played a darker role than he ever did before. In an age when we worried about pedophiles, and also worried needlessly about people accused in atrocious error of being pedophiles, Carroll's fascination for little girls has become suspect and smutty. Academic papers have been issued to reinforce such views, but all are largely circumstantial. Thus it seems wiser to think of Carroll with more magnanimity, and to remember that he was never in his time considered anything more threatening than a respectable Oxford don with an eagerness to entertain by mathematical and linguistic puzzles and stories. The popular press has followed the academic lead, however. The darker themes of Wonderland have been brought out in recent illustrations for the books, but even here, "... none of these illustrators taps to any noticeable degree into the reading of _Alice_ as steeped in sexual overtone..." Brooker shows how the original illustrations by Sir John Tenniel have always influenced subsequent illustrators. Brooker has great fun taking part in the activities of the Lewis Carroll Society, and finds a pleasant peer pressure: when he wrote to other members he found himself gradually using an address that was much more formal and polite "...than I would ever have used towards, say, the _Star Wars_ fans of my previous research."_Alice's Adventures_ gives a look back to how other generations interpreted the tales. The stories don't have pedophilia in them, but these suppositions color our current view of the author. In the 1930s, there were abundant psychoanalytic interpretations, and in the 1960s there were psychedelic interpretations. Brooker also spends a chapter on an animated computer shooter game, "Dark Wonderland," with Alice as a sexually provocative heroine. The books themselves, however, represent to Brooker "...an innocent, timeless, very English work of charming fantasy, suitable for reissue to another generation of young readers." In showing Alice in current culture, Brooker has written an admiring tribute to Carroll and his creation that will have the laudable effect of getting readers to look again at an inspired original.

review/summary: A Wasp Without a Wig
review/text: Will Brooker is the handsomest former nerd in central London, and he takes his own edge off by cligning to the little bit inside him that still feels rejected, neglected, and put on the shelf by the cooler kids. His analysis of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass feels like something actually felt, not just abstracted, and it's clear that he keeps taking down from the hook all these various interpretations of Lewis Carroll's character, unable to settle on one, to see which one fits him the best. He is relentlessly modish and thoroughly up-to-date, and yet an old-fashioned drive for completion gives his character an uncharacteristic burnish, an OCD shadow. His book is terrifically written, on a sentence by sentence basis, but after awhile it does get wearisome, usually because like a handful of other practitioners of deconstructionist theory, Brooker is unable to give another full credit without sniping away at him or her. Every text that he picks up to examine will be revealed to have some huge flaw which Brooker doesn't share in.He's divided his study into nine general areas, from representations of Lewis Carroll in recent biography, to the fandom with which his own recent work has been concerned. At least one of these topics, the section in which he critiques many illustrators of Lewis Carroll, should have been jettisoned for, despite what he thinks, Brooker lacks the ability to write well about the visual arts, odd for one who has written extensively on many comic artists, but alas, he's pretty bankrupt there. Another chapter devotes itself to contemporary sequels to ALICE, including Jeff Noon and Gilbert Adair, and here again a weakness in Brooker's comprehensive approach becomes obvious at once: although he has just about nothing to say about Adair's ALICE THROUGH THE NEEDLE'S EYE, he feels obliged to "cover" it with the same word count as he does everything else.Against these minor flaws Brooker's book is an arsenal of critical insight and, as well, sheer writing chops. His opening salvo, tearing apart a series of biographers for their outright misstatements and lack of perspective, could hardly be better planned nor achieved. I would never have thought of the simple method he winds up using, which is, he isolates five areas of mystery in Carrollian biography, and one by one he examines what X, Y, or Z says about each. For example, what of the cut diary pages? What about the heartfelt diary entries which entreat his God to make him a more decent man? And what about those nude photographs of little boys and girls?OK, maybe he tries to do too much, and depends on his own adorableness for pages at a time, but this is a thoroughly exciting book and I hope Brooker sees fit to keep it up to date in the years to come, maybe staging an Alice Biennale or something like.

review/summary: Nice, but dry
review/text: This book is what is says, a review of Alice and the way people understand it. If that interests you, this is a good book. For a Carolinian who just wants to see about the effects, but not get too far into the detail, this book is too dry.Too much time spent on American Mcgee's Alice, and the nuances are borderline psychobabble. This might be better for a research document on the subject as the points are valid, just not that interesting.I'm almost done reading the book. I'm trudging through more to "finish it" for the sake of finishing it, rather than out of interest.I'd recommend this book for skimming.-----1/23/10 Finally finished the book. The last two chapters are more interesting. In the penultimate, he analyzes responses from society members. It's odd, but it rings true. The final chapter is interesting, in that it has a different feeling than the rest of the book. Whereas in the rest of the book he studies from the outside--even when joining the society it is for the book--the final chapter is his tour of Alice sites. Will Booker is no longer the researcher, but the interested patron. It's as if before he left the scene, he decided to get into it once himself, just to have done it.But the sites he visited were lackluster, and the interest was just not there. His tone is sort of bittersweet, and i almost wished i was there to share it with him. In a strange way, he was going on his pilgrimage for our sake, and found nothing worth our time. His final analysis of what he would tell Carrol (not what he said he would actually say, but his study of it when he thought about it) seemed so true.This doesn't change my impression of the book overall. But i do think the final chapter is ironic. It is doubtful it will mean anything to anything who hasn't read the rest of the book, but i read the entire book and i finally got to the last chapter, and what i found was as unrewarding as the very pilgrimage he himself recorded there.I don't mean to knock the author. If i saw him, i'd thank him for the book and (hopefully) have a good talk with him. But for the book itself, it's interesting but dry.

review/text: Lewis Carroll wrote "Alice In Wonderland" and is most noted for this achievement, but he did so much more, fostering the setting for later computer games, theme parks, and performances inspired by his works. Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll In Popular Culture isn't just another coverage of Carroll's life; it's a survey of how the characters he created live on in modern times, adapted since his death in 1898. The analysis juxtaposes perfectly with his life and times and creates for more depth in the analysis of Alice's ongoing effects on modern culture, than the modern biography could achieve.

The 'myth' has been dealt with far better by people who really seem to understand it (it's too deep I think for Brooker's milieu), and the pop culture is presented without any kind of analysis or penetration.I think you are better off with Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild' or Sigler's 'Alternative Alices'.

review/summary: IMAGES OF ALICE
review/text: Possibly the 60s were the time when Alice began to enter the popular culture.In 1963 for example there was a girl singer who named herself Alice Wonderland and made a single.A month or two earlier Neil Sedaka had landed Alice on to the Top 40.A matter of months later,as the Beatles began to conquer America,came John Lennon's 2nd book,like the first,influenced by Lewis Carroll's nonsense writings. (Carroll would be further immortalised by the Beatles when he was one of the figures on the Sgt Pepper sleeve).Then came the first rumblings of the new American music influenced by both the Beatles and folk music in general.The Great Society were one of many trying for a bite of the cherry and lead singer Grace Slick wrote a song called "White Rabbit",more or less a comment about parents who gave their kids Alice books then wondered why they ended up taking drugs.(Obviously tongue in cheek as Slick took more than her share during the Jefferson Airplane years:this was the band who she joined after the Great Society taking with her the 2 songs they'd recorded ,one of which was "White Rabbit". The rest is history.Alice has always been at least of enough fascination to the music world as to have inspired no end of songs or band names from "Alice In Sunderland" to the Mock Turtles,Carolyn Wonderland or even the very title of the 2nd book ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS,who were a duo from the village of Ditchling in Suffolk and who wrote some music for a local Alice production.The album was a limited edition and is now worth over 1000 as its regarded as Folk Rock or whatever but even the reissue is worth quite a bitSomeday the definitive book may be written about the Alice influence on popular music but meanwhile there's this one

review/summary: An Absolute Masterpiece of Horror
review/text: This is a terrific horror novel. It takes place in an old mansion (of 160 rooms) in the Adirondack mountains that hides an intriguing and unqiue dark secret to it. The lead characters are a young woman, newlywed to a famous rock musician and her son from a previous relationship. The attempt to merge the three into a family is difficult. Things get worse when the boy is visited by spectral beings in the house. I have reread this novel on several occasions and enjoyed it each time. The blurb from publishers weekly above appears to be from some other book entirely and should be discounted. This is a relatively short haunted house style novel that will keep you hooked from beginning to end and deserves to be remembered as one of the greats.

review/summary: THIS ONE DESERVES FAR MORE THAN JUST FIVE STARS
review/text: Recently, while taking inventory (cleaning up my mess) of my library, I ran across my old copy of this book that has been with me since the mid 1950s. Being a strong believer is setting priorities, I instantly sat down, ceased the silly cleaning, and started reading the book once again. My goodness! I know it is impossible, but I am quite sure that old, really good books, get even better with age, just like wine! This is certainly the case with this one.This work was first published in 1935. It was the first book that I had read by this author and, I must say, it hooked me. This is probably one of the greatest dog stories ever written. People constantly compare it to Where the Red Fern Grows, but to be honest, I personally feel Kantor's work is better written. The story takes place in the Ozark Mountains and is simply about the love a man has toward his dog. Now the story is much more complex than this, but this is what it boils down to in the end. Now take warning, this is a tear jerker. I remember crying when I was a little one while reading it, and the book had the same effect on me just a week ago. This author's prose is beyond equal in my opinion and he has the time, the place, the people and the era down perfectly.On a personal note, the author names several people in this book, old time dog men and fox hunters. I had the pleasure and honor of knowing several of these old men while I was growing up and knew their sons and daughters quite well. They were a unique breed and I feel much richer for having known them and having been raised amongst them. I suppose this makes this work a bit special for me.Now this book has fox hunting in it, although it is not a hunting book. The reader should understand this particular sport, which was not a blood sport by any means. In fact, actually killing the fox was considered very bad form and was just something you did not do. Basically it consisted of setting around a fire all night listening to your dog run a fox through the hills. I have spent many evenings doing this and could certainly relate. I do not hunt anymore, having given it up years ago, but I do make an exception anytime I have the opportunity to participate in this particular type of hunting. Probably not true, but it almost seems the fox enjoys the chase almost as much as the dogs and humans do.If you are looking for a truly well written book, love dogs, and stories of very interesting people (the kind of people that it is difficult to find now days), then this one is for you. This particular work is on my list of top ten all time favorites. Recommend it highly. (Further note: If you happened to see the movie which was made in 1936, please do not judge the book by that viewing as per usual, the movie people missed it completely.)

review/text: The Voice of Bugle Ann is a short novel but Mr Kantor's prose brought the story to life--I could hear Bugle Ann just as her owner did and I could feel his anger and sorrow at her lose. This is a powerful book showing to what extent man will go for his best friend--I came across this book on one of the Amazon lists and decided to try it--I could not have been more impressed.

And that is where I first heard of Kantor and this wonderful book. I'm just rereading it and once again basking in quality story telling by a master who knew and understood his genre.Highly recommended reading for animal lovers and those who appreciate truly fine writing.

review/text: I was so impressed with the court scene and the speech about man's best friend in the movie (by the same name, and with Lionel Barrymore) that I had to have a copy of it. I mistakenly thought I'd find that speech in the book. Hollywood took artist license with that but I was still impressed to find that the book was inspired by a true life story. This book led me to find the very interesting facts when I researched it via my computer. The speech was actually spoken although the actual event was altered some. See the movie, read the book, then look up the history. Great stuff.

review/summary: for the love of dogs
review/text: I like any book that celebrates dogs, children and redemption. This one describes a tradition of fox hunting that is about the dogs and not the humans. It is a story steeped in the fox hunting lore of a part of the country where foxes are chased but not harmed by the dogs. And the thrills are about listening to the dogs run throughout the night and returning at dawn. It is a classic dog story .

review/summary: America, where some beliefs were born
review/text: Beliefs A book reviewIts been said that we learn nothing from history. This appears to be true, but only to the extent that history is ignored. When we pay attention to history, we are bound to learn something. A good dose of history can sometimes put us back on a road we've tended to leave. This may be the case while reading a brief account of how America and the American way of came to be.In some 230 pages John Harmon McElroy reminds readers of the various reasons America developed as it did. McElroy, in American Beliefs (1999) from Ivan Dee Publishers, Chicago, expounds upon twenty-five beliefs or ideas that have contributed to America's development. The book, subtitled: &quot;What keeps a big country and a diverse people united,&quot; has ten chapters. McElroy, professor emeritus of English at the University of Arizona, would have his readers look at the things which have kept us, as a people, together instead of the things which have so often divided us.The 24 beliefs are listed under seven of the ten chapter headings: Primary Beliefs of American Culture, Immigrant Beliefs, Frontier Beliefs, Religious and Moral Beliefs, Social Beliefs, Political Beliefs and Beliefs on Human Nature. Along the way in his treatment of these beliefs McElroy shows how it came about that the land which developed into America was different from developments in Canada, Central &amp; western South America and in Brazil. All of these areas were receiving European emigrants at about the same time, but development here was much different than in the other regions. So the author works to give a broad overview of history and how America came forth in a unique way.One example of the beliefs McElroy presents is one we might think is only common sense: everyone must work. Such an idea or belief, it seems, developed in contrast to what was usual in England and much of northern Europe, the areas from which most people came. In the old country there was an aristocracy in which certain people, because of their birthrights, were expected to be served by others, those lesser-born people. This system did not work on these shores as there was simply to much to do, to survive...no place for lazy bones. So those who expected to be served were told, in effect, work or die. (Sounds like: 2 Thessalonians 3:10 &quot;For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.&quot;) So those who had wished to be served, worked..and the belief that everyone must work became a part of our culture, and pretty much remains that way today. While people reach different economic stages, none is considered a nobleman by birth.and this was a new idea.McElroy takes a little different twist on the idea that America is a chosen land, as being chosen of God. On page 131 he says: &quot;The United States is God's country in the sense that Americans for many generations have felt that their nation has been especially blessed by God, that it could never have been established and endured so successfully without God's favor and protection. The belief is also true in the sense that, as a people, Americans have believed that God has wanted to use America as part of a divine plan for the redemption of mankind, by the creation of a new nation modeled on new principles of behavior. America is also a 'chosen country' in the sense that those who created it were mostly those who chose to emigrate to it and descendants.&quot;Of special interested in these days of much discussion about the idea of Freedom of Religion, McElroy addresses the 'free exercise' clause of that first amendment to the U-S Constitution. Like many who insist that the Constitution only makes sense when its original intent is maintained, he makes this statement which needs to resound in many courts and public places today: &quot;No provision of the Constitution protects any citizen from being offended by the religious practices of another citizen.&quot; How often we have instituted some legislation because someone is offended by religion, but the Constitution says there shall be 'freedom to exercise' our religious positions, regardless of any offense received., perhaps limited only to the extent of causing some public hazard. This clearly points out the value of history because as we have gotten away from initial Constitutional meanings, we have wandered off the road into confusion.The books concludes with some observations, that much has happened in this culture in the past 40 years or so, perhaps instigated by the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate school prayers. &quot;It is certain,&quot; he says, &quot; that since WW-II some principles of American culture have been emphasized to the detriment of others. The principle of freedom, for instance, has been promoted without regard to responsibility, calls for improvement have been made without regard to practicality, and equality has sometimes been demanded with a zeal that ignores differences among individuals. Too often in the last 40 years of the 20th century, it seems, America's cultural history has been set aside in favor of uncompromising ideologies.&quot;The book is an easy read and recommended for anyone interested in American history, especially high school and college students needing a better appreciation of what it means to be an American.Dan Schobert August 29, 1999

review/summary: Makes My Blood Run Red-White-And-Blue
review/text: I agree that every American should read this book -- and everybody else for that matter. I don't agree that it's scholarly. Rather, it's a joy to read -- easy to understand even for a person with two master's degrees! Between McElroy's chapter on How American Culture was Formed and Ken Burns' Lewis &amp; Clark, I don't know which makes my blood run red-white-and-bluer. And as a child of the anti-establishment `60s, it's done a lot toward helping me understand why we Americans do what we do. It's the best history book I've ever read, the best history course I've ever taken or taught. I'm buying it for my home library for my grandchildren to use as a resource. We're also using it as a resource for a book on urban planning.

review/text: As a social studies teacher (middle grades and secondary level), this book has provided me with invaluable discussion points and lesson plan ideas. In a time when we are trying to make learning relevant and exciting for our young students, this text will be a tremendous aid to me while I facilitate real learning in a public school classroom. John McElroy has genuinely motivated me to teach both history and civics in a whole new light. For all readers of this book, be aware that a resurgence of pride in our country is bound to occur! Furthermore, all Americans will frequently internally recognize the principles that are inherent in American culture. Of course, it is not a primer for zealous nationalism; rather, it is a honest exploration into the realm of the history of American culture. It is entertaining and informative. It is the best book I have read in several years!

review/summary: A Unique Look at America
review/text: Over the years I have read hundreds of books about America and this book is clearly one of the most stunning. In general, the book is well researched, well organized, and very readable. It explains America to Americans and to the world in a different and very clear and convincing way. Through most of the book I was enthralled. Most of his examples are well chosen, precise, concise, and convincing. But it is not perfect.There are, in my opinion, two areas in the book which fail to match the high quality of thought, reason, and rationale found through most of it. First, in the chapter about Social Beliefs, McElroy appears to see America's history from the perspective of the proverbial WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) and thus he ignores the lack of inclusion in the American mainstream at various times of such groups as Eastern European immigrants, Catholic immigrants, non-Christian immigrants, Asian immigrants, and Hispanic immigrants. He also neglects to mention that, in general, Americans of mixed raced were/are denigrated by both of the races from which they were/are descended. And he concludes the chapter by saying that if immigrants fail to succeed socially and economically in America it is no one's fault but there own. How amazingly naive.Second, all of his fairness and impartiality and perspective seem to fall apart in the concluding section in which he views a very narrow period of time in America (the last 40 years or so) and suggests that many of the values on which this country was founded and built have fallen to the wayside. He concludes by saying there are some signs that things might get better over time. Certainly damning with faint praise. He sounds like an ultra conservative radio commentator. It spoils the flavor of the entire book. It is almost as if the rest of the book was just a way of reeling the reader in so that he could present this final diatribe. A sad finish to an otherwise excellent book.

Why are we so different from other countries and how did it happen? Unfortunately this book does not offer any answers but it is clear that we are loosing our American beliefs.....which makes reading and recommending this book even more important.
